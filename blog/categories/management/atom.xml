    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a developer, you work on software projects, right? ...Or are they <em>software products</em>?</p>

<p>Like many others in the software industry, you might think those two concepts are synonyms; but they aren’t. In fact, whether the software being developed is considered a project or a product may have critical and non-trivial ramifications, in many aspects.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.romenrg.com/images/products_vs_projects.jpg" alt="Team meeting in which multiple colleagues discuss in a table, where several computres are opened. One man moves hands displaying confusion" /></p>

<p>The <em>not-so-subtle</em> differences between software projects and software products actually have a huge impact on our behavior, both from a business as well as from an engineering perspective.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>For many years I’ve been trying to find the time to write about this key difference, to which many people in tech fail to give importance to. About a year ago, I had the opportunity to give a <a href="https://www2.slideshare.net/romenrg/agile-software-development-beyond-projects-ull">lecture</a> on this very topic. And now, I have finally decided to write about this important topic in more detail.</p>

<p>I'll start with definitions, digging into the key differences that derive from them. Afterwards, I'll explore the critical behavioral ramifications. However, if you just want a quick summary, feel free to jump directly to the <a href="#detailed-comparison">comparison table</a>.</p>

<h2>Let’s start with some definitions</h2>

<p>If we want to get a clear definition of "project" and “<a href="https://www.pmi.org/about/learn-about-pmi/what-is-project-management">project management</a>", the Project Management Institute (PMI) can probably be of some help. From their site we can extract two clear sentences that are relevant in this context:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>project</strong> is temporary in that it has a defined beginning and end in time, and therefore defined scope and resources.</li>
<li><strong>Project management</strong>, then, is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet the project requirements.</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, if we try to look for definitions of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)">product</a>” and “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_management">product management</a>”, we can probably summarize them as:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>product</strong> is an object or system made available for consumer use; it is anything that can be offered to a market to satisfy the desire or need of a customer.</li>
<li><strong>Product management</strong>, then, drives the business case for product development and has an active role throughout its development, test and launch; being also involved in product change and lifecycle decisions and planning.</li>
</ul>


<p>Can you tell the key differences already?</p>

<h2>Digging into the differences</h2>

<h3>Two key differences, from definitions</h3>

<p>From the definitions above, we can clearly see the first big difference: the temporary nature of a project. <strong>Projects are time-constrained efforts</strong>, supposed to have a defined beginning and end date. This clearly-defined temporary nature does not apply to products, which don’t have such predefined beginning and end in time, being subject to market demand instead.</p>

<p>Moreover, those clearly defined time boundaries for projects also bring the second clear distinction: fixed scope and resources (i.e. the project requirements). This doesn’t apply to products either. <strong>Products are evolving creatures by nature</strong>. While project management cares about meeting those predefined project requirements; product management cares about the business case for the product, constantly learning from users and having an active role in the product lifecycle, defining new features and/or re-prioritizing work, adapting to market needs.</p>

<h3><a id="detailed-comparison"></a>Detailed comparison</h3>

<p>When I was preparing my lecture, I found a very nice article by Sriram Narayan in Martin Fowler’s blog. In his article, Sriram added a very comprehensive <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/products-over-projects.html#WhatIsProduct-mode">table comparing project-mode and product-mode</a>.</p>

<p>For this article, I have created my own simplified table; focusing only on some key aspects I would like to compare for the two cases.</p>

<h2>Software development is mainly about building products</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.romenrg.com/blog/2015/09/28/why-asking-developers-for-time-estimates-in-software-projects-is-a-terrible-idea-and-how-to-bypass-it-with-scrum/#the-role-of-evil-contracts">Software development involves many unknowns</a>. Those unknowns make it extremely hard for us to have the certainties "projects" require upfront. At the beginning is when we know the least about the software what we are building.</p>

<h3>In the digital economy, software evolves constantly</h3>

<p>Think of the software you use in your daily life. Isn't it always evolving? You receive constant updates, not only for bugfixing; but also to add new features, <a href="https://www.romenrg.com/blog/2013/01/02/improving-the-ui-to-achieve-a-better-ux-my-experience-in-stat4you/">improve the UX</a>, or even to remove pieces that are no longer relevant.</p>

<p>Does this fit into the definition of "project" we saw before? Do these applications have “a defined beginning and end in time”? And how about scope and resources, do they seem to have been fixed upfront?</p>

<p>Change and evolution are natural in products, but not in projects. Projects don't welcome change. And software evolves constantly.</p>

<h3>Software products and outsourcing are not a good fit</h3>

<p>Traditionally, it has been common for non-software organizations to outsource software development initiatives. For instance, Government agencies typically outsource their “software development projects”, even though in most cases they should have been thinking in terms of software products instead.</p>

<p>Think of an e-gov application in which citizens can perform their bureaucratic obligations from home. Isn’t that a software product? It will have to evolve, as new laws are passed. And it is not supposed to have a predefined teardown day. Instead, we would probably expect it to be there for the long run. Over time, citizens (users) will discover bugs, which will have to be addressed; and we will likely complain about it and/or suggest improvements. There might also be scalability issues and/or outages that will have to be tackled.</p>

<p>Treating these software products as outsourced projects means that the owners will hire an external company to build it. Usually the cheapest. The project will have a fixed scope, and the parties will agree on a timeline and on a price. The external company will complete the project, according to those parameters and hand it over to the customer. Then, usually, the external company forgets about it. If changes are desired in the future, new projects will be defined and outsourced. Often to different companies.</p>

<p>In most cases, the company that is hired to build the software is not involved in the discovery process with potential users. They are not involved in the prioritization of features. They are just hired to do X, as quickly and cheaply as possible. And since they are not rewarded for software quality nor for asking questions, they will probably build it without maintenance in their minds. And they won’t question decisions nor worry about gathering data.</p>

<p>Now, think how different it would be if it was treated as a software product, with an in-house team building it and participating in all the process, from conception to evolution. The team would understand needs, motivations and strategic goals; they would be engaged. They would ask questions. Hypotheses could be defined together and data collection and learning would be in everybody’s mind since the beginning. Working in small increments would be easier. Writing maintainable code becomes crucial. Changes are welcome. And quality matters.</p>

<p>Being aware of the importance of software products in the digital economy means that, if your software is (or is becoming) the core of your business, then you keep software development in-house. Nowadays, every company is a software company. Think of Airbnb, Lyft or Netflix. These businesses could have opted to externalize software development, but they realized the software products they were building are the core of their business. They realized they were software companies.</p>

<h3>How about open source "projects"?</h3>

<p>It is common in the software industry to hear people refer to “open source projects”. In most cases, though, I would argue we should be talking about “open source products” instead.</p>

<p>I have been an open source software (OSS) user for many years, and I have also contributed to open source myself. One example of OSS to which I have contributed is <a href="http://jenkins.io/">Jenkins</a>. Jenkins is the leading open source automation server. It has been around for more than 15 years, with millions of installations worldwide. And it has evolved significantly, including the fork from Hudson, the recent UI changes, and the thousands of ever-evolving plugins, created by a thriving open source community. Based on this data and the previous definitions, should we consider Jenkins an “open source project” or, rather, an “open source product”?</p>

<p>I understand that, when somebody (like Kohsuke with Jenkins) starts to build an open source software, they might have a limited and well defined idea. And they may work on a “project” to make it happen. A project to build the first set of fixed features for their idea. But then, if it is successful, that initial project leads to a product that keeps evolving in unanticipated ways. Scope is no longer fixed, as the community starts to bring new ideas and prioritize their development; and there is no defined “end date”.</p>

<p>Successful open source "projects" are here to stay, for a long time. But their success will keep them evolving within their communities, as <em>software products</em>.</p>

<h2>My personal take</h2>

<p>As you may have guessed after reading this article, I’m a big fan of building software as products. I have built many in my career; and <a href="https://www.romenrg.com/blog/2015/03/17/10-plus-1-valuable-lessons-i-learned-from-my-failed-startup/">I’ve learned a lot</a> from those experiences.</p>

<p>But building software as products is not just what I enjoy the most. It is truly the way I believe we should be building software, to get the most out of it.</p>

<p>Software projects are dead. Long live <em>software products</em>.</p>

    <id>https://www.romenrg.com/blog/2019/12/31/everything-as-code</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are in the software industry, and specially if you are in the DevOps space, you are probably familiar with the concepts of "Infrastructure as code" and "Configuration as code", which are very popular lately. But, what if that same idea could be applied to everything else in a software company? Aren't documentation and training great candidates for becoming "as-code" as well?</p>

<p><img src="https://www.romenrg.com/images/dwjw2019_lisbon_talk.jpg" alt="Picture taken during the presentation at DWJW 2019. I'm showing the tech stack of the new CloudBees' training platform" /></p>

<p>During 2019 I've been intensively working on this idea at <a href="https://standard.cbu.cloudbees.com/">CloudBees University</a>, along with my colleagues. Nowadays, for our training platform and courses everything is done "as code".</p>

<p>Sounds interesting? Keep reading to learn more about it and/or watch the <a href="https://www.romenrg.com/blog/2019/12/31/everything-as-code/#training-as-code-talk">"Training As Code" talk</a> my colleague Mark Waite and I delivered at DevOps World | Jenkins World in December 2019.</p>

<!-- More -->


<h2>Infrastructure and configuration as code</h2>

<p>Moving infrastructure definition and application configuration to code has been a huge step forward for us as an industry. It has allowed us to automate many "opearions" tasks, saving significant time, reducing human errors and allowing us to have a clear "state" of our software products, their infrastructure and configuration. And it has also contributed to bridge the gap between "development" and "operations", improving collaboration between these teams.</p>

<p>When it comes to tools and technologies, Terraform, Chef, Puppet, Salt, Ansible, Docker and Kubernetes, among others, have played a crucial role in this movement; enabling engineers to describe infrastrucutre and configuration as code.</p>

<h2>How about documentation?</h2>

<p>It's been a while since many technologies and tools have shifted their documentation to code. Many of the most popular open source tools are hosted in GitHub, and typically most of them contain at least a README file in the repo itself, often written in Markdown (but can also be written in alternative languages, such as <a href="http://asciidoc.org/">AsciiDoc</a>).</p>

<p>Also, blogging tools, like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, have geared to this concept as well; using Markdown files to represent the different posts, that are later rendered into HTML.</p>

<p>And this trend is also accelerating. Nowadays I see many relevant projects and tools shifting their documentation sites to code. Among the benefits, not only does it allow us to treat everything that belongs (or relates to) a software product equally, but it also improves collaboration between teams. Engineers are much more likely to contribute to documentation if it is written as code, and specially if it is in the very same repo in which the code is. This shift is actually helping to break silos again, as it did between development and operations.</p>

<p>Moreover, having documentation as code makes it easier for us to include documentation-specific stages in our CI/CD pipelines, such as spelling checks or broken links validations.</p>

<h2>Combining these concepts in CloudBees University</h2>

<p>In CloudBees University we offer several courses, most of them focused on <a href="https://jenkins.io/">Jenkins</a> (targeting audiences with different level of knowledge in Jenkins administration or Jenkins pipelines). Those courses are highly technical and have significant "hands on" pieces. The content is displayed as a website, while for the hands on part, we provide students with lab environments in which they have the different tools they need for the course, with the specific configuration needed for the different exercises they have to complete.</p>

<h3>Everything "as code"</h3>

<p>Needless to say everything is done as code, from our content to the lab environments and their configuration.</p>

<p>Want to know more? Mark and I explained all the details in our talk at DevOps World | Jenkins World 2019, which we recorded and is available below.</p>

<p>As we said during the talk, we are still learning and improving, but it's been a great experience. This approach has allowed us to achieve things that wouldn't have been possible if we were relying on manual tasks. Now we have a single source of truth for everything in CloudBees University, we have peer-reviews for any change we make, clear versioning and history and, of course, fully automated <a href="https://www.romenrg.com/blog/2017/12/31/continuous-integration-delivery-deployment/">CI/CD</a> processes, for integrations and deployments.</p>

<p>Now, how about you? Are you doing "everything as code" already?</p>

    <id>https://www.romenrg.com/blog/2018/12/29/what-makes-a-great-software-engineer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The software industry has been growing significantly for the last few decades, and this trend seems to only be accelerating.</p>

<p>Due to this fast growth, there has been an ever-increasing demand for software engineers and, since there are not enough developers to meet the demand, many companies often fail to cover their open positions. But, is it also possible that we are looking at the wrong skills when hiring?</p>

<p><img src="https://www.romenrg.com/images/question_unsplash.jpg" alt="Picture of a cofee mug with a question mug" /></p>

<p>Most job descriptions simply list a set of technologies as the necessary “profile” for the open position. However… Aren’t there other skills that could have a higher impact on developer’s success?</p>

<p>Are we looking at the right skills?</p>

<!-- More -->


<h2>Beyond languages and frameworks</h2>

<p>So, despite the shortage of software engineers, we keep seeing, with dismay, that many companies keep restricting their opening positions to people with experience in very specific sets of technologies. Often stating that “X years of experience in <em>&lt;new framework Y></em>” is a key requirement.</p>

<p>Have you thought that it's very likely that <a href="https://sizovs.net/2018/12/17/stop-learning-frameworks/">you will not be using <em>&lt;new framework Y></em> in two years</a>? When that happens, which would be the skills your team will need to keep being productive?</p>

<p>It's great to keep an eye on new technologies, of course, as they might bring relevant innovations to our businesses; but focusing mostly on trendy frameworks or on our current tech stack, when hiring, has negative impacts in the long-run and, as a general practice, is very harmful to our industry. We need to move forward. <strong>This focus on languages and frameworks hints there is a fundamental misunderstanding in what makes a great software developer.</strong></p>

<h2>The software industry is evolving constantly</h2>

<p>Granted, if you need an urgent short-term solution for a framework-specific problem, you may want to find someone that knows it deeply. However, more often than not, those short-term needs hide long-term problems in a company.</p>

<p>Developing software is often about making processes more eficient and providing solutions to existing challenges. Also, we now know that due to the fast pace at which both technology and our needs evolve, <a href="https://www.romenrg.com/blog/2015/09/28/why-asking-developers-for-time-estimates-in-software-projects-is-a-terrible-idea-and-how-to-bypass-it-with-scrum/">software development is a continuous process</a>. In most cases software products don’t have an end. We add new features, teams change, companies pivot in their strategy, new technologies bring new opportunities for enhancements, consumer demands change... And we just keep evolving our digital products.</p>

<p>This constant innovation brings constant changes, both in business and in technology. Our products change, as well as the languages, frameworks, tools and devices we use.</p>

<h2>Fortunately, key skills are evergreen</h2>

<p>Isn't there “evergreen” technical knowledge that can be portable across frameworks? Aren't "soft" skills vital? How about code readability, learning-ability and communication skills? Wouldn't those skills be more valuable than framework-specific knowledge in this ever-evolving world?</p>

<h3>It’s not just about technology</h3>

<p>There are skills that often have a higher impact on success than technical knowledge. The so-called "soft" skills (or <a href="https://github.com/romenrg/evergreen-skills-developers#core-skills-aka-soft-skills">core skills</a>) are crucial for any software developer: being able to communicate properly (via email, chat or face-to-face), sharing knowledge with coworkers, engaging in constructive discussions...</p>

<p>Every day more relevant voices in the industry are raising concerns about his. Sam Altman recently shared his <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/981690839280771073?lang=en">hiring priorities</a>: values first, aptitude second, specific skills third. Buffer is also a very innovative company in this area, with a <a href="https://open.buffer.com/hiring-process/">culture-fit-based hiring process</a>, where "soft" skills play a key role.</p>

<h3>But there is also technical evergreen knowledge</h3>

<p>Despite the constant change of technology, the technical principles and best practices that also make a software engineer great, are portable across frameworks.</p>

<p>This is a heated discussion. It is indeed difficult to name "fundamentals" or even to draw a line separating technologies that are evergreen from those that are just temporary, as can be seen in the dicussion between <a href="https://twitter.com/zachleat/status/1074776108422307840">Zach Leatherman</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/seldo/status/1075027798333493249">Laurie Voss</a>.</p>

<p>However, when I refer to "evergreen" technical knowledge, I mean <a href="https://github.com/romenrg/evergreen-skills-developers#general-technical-knowledge">principles</a>, such as OOP and SOLID; data structures, SCM, Clean Code guidelines or DevOps practices.</p>

<h3>The repository of "evergreen" knowledge to the rescue</h3>

<p>So, since 1) nowadays most opennings still focus only on technologies and 2) coming up with the "evergreen" knowledge that we could use for hiring interviews is not trivial, I have gone ahead and created <a href="https://github.com/romenrg/evergreen-skills-developers">this GitHub repository</a>, which goal is to serve as a pool of ideas to condut a fair assessment of skilled software developers / engineers.</p>

<p>As stated in the repository, the purpose of this work is to serve as an alternative resource for conducting hiring interviews of software developers / engineers. It focuses on software development best practices, cross-framework principles and other portable skills; instead of the usual focus on specific languages, frameworks and trends, which tend to quickly become outdated and often don't reflect the real value software developers / engineers bring to the organization.</p>

<p>It is also worth mentioning that it is a work in progress, so important knowledge might be missing, existing bullets can probably be improved and better grouping strategies could be found. For those reasons, any contributions (i.e. PRs) are welcome. Please feel free to propose changes following <a href="https://github.com/romenrg/evergreen-skills-developers/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">the contributing guideline</a>.</p>

<h2>Be the change you want to see in the world</h2>

<p>We all have a role in moving our industry forward. As a manager, think twice when designing the description for your new open position and <a href="https://github.com/romenrg/evergreen-skills-developers">look for ideas beyond a list of technologies</a>; as an individual contributor, when you are asked about the skills your next coworker should have, ask for principles and best-practices; as a candidate, highlight your "evergreen" knowledge and its importance. We owe it to the profession we love.</p>

<p>I have created the <a href="https://github.com/romenrg/evergreen-skills-developers">evergreen skills repository</a> as my two cents' contribution to this discussion. As I wrote before, it is a work in progress, which means there is a lot of room for improvement. I have added contributing guidelines and all constructive PRs are welcome... So I look forward to you contributions!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment are key modern practices in software development. These techniques help us reduce integration problems, automate quality assessment and make deployments much more predictable and less error prone, allowing us to deploy easily and frequently. But… Do you really know the differences between the three?</p>

<p><img src="https://www.romenrg.com/images/two_paths_fork_unsplash.jpg" alt="Picture of a fork in the trail in a forest, leading to two alternative paths" /></p>

<p>The aim of this article is to help clarify what do these techniques mean and highlight the benefits each one provides. We will also analyze which one should be chosen depending on the circumstances.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>This year I have been deeply involved in the subject, since I have been working on setting up Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery in <a href="http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/platino/">Platino</a>, which is a big government project that has been around for almost 10 years. Platino receives tens of millions of requests every month and has a considerable codebase, being composed of more than 50 web services and 9 web applications.</p>

<p>During this time I have realized that, despite the importance of these practices, many professionals in the industry still miss the differences between the three, often talking about them indistinctly in conversations, which creates a lot of confusion around the topic. So, let's check the differences:</p>

<h2>Continuous Integration</h2>

<p>The concept of Continuous Integration (CI) was originally proposed by Grady Booch in 1991 and later integrated into <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">Extreme Programming</a>. From then on, specially thanks to the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Software Development</a> movement (as well as <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/devops">DevOps culture</a>), the technique has been widely adopted in the industry.</p>

<h3>Core proposition</h3>

<p>The core proposition of Continuous Integration is associated with Version Control Systems (VCS). It was originally described as a simple technique, which consisted of integrating developers' work (their working copies or branches) to the mainline (<em>trunk</em> in subversion or <em>master</em> branch in git) at least once a day.</p>

<p>The idea behind these daily integrations to the mainline is to reduce integration problems, which are usually caused by the complexity of merging the work of developers that have been working isolatedly for a while. By integrating daily or after each commit, the complexity of the merge process is drastically reduced, as can be seen in the following example:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.romenrg.com/images/branches_without_ci.png"><img src="https://www.romenrg.com/images/branches_without_ci.png" alt="Image of two developers working isolatedly over time, creating several commits before merging" /></a></p>

<p><em>Example of two developers creating several commits in their corresponding branches before merging. Squares represent commits and the circle represents the big merge that has to be made at the end.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.romenrg.com/images/branches_ci.png"><img src="https://www.romenrg.com/images/branches_ci.png" alt="Image of two developers applying continuous integration, integrating each change into the mainline" /></a></p>

<p><em>Example of two developers applying the original concept of Continuous Integration, integrating every change into the mainline. As before, squares represent commits and circles represent merges, which are much simpler now, due to the high frequency of integration.</em></p>

<h3>Extended Continuous Integration</h3>

<p>Although the core proposition of CI, described above, has value on itself, <strong>the definition of Continuous Integration was soon broadened</strong>. Nowadays, it often implies the existence of a CI Server (such as <a href="https://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a>) that, once a new change is made to the mainline of the VCS, executes a <a href="https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/">Continuous Integration Pipeline</a>. These pipelines are formed of different stages, executed sequentially on every integraton. Their goal, <a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html">as Martin Fowler states</a>, is <strong>to verify every integration with an automated build</strong>, to detect integration errors as quickly as possible. These builds include at least the compilation of the source code and the execution of unit tests, although in many cases other stages such as packaging, execution of integration / end-to-end tests and static code analysis are also included in these Continuous Integration Pipelines.</p>

<p>In this extended definition, the pipeline can either finish successfully or a failure can be produced in any of the stages (tests failing, static analysis not passing a defined threshold….). Usually, in the event of a failure, a notification email is sent to the person that created the last commit (probably the one causing the failure). In such cases, in order to really get the benefits of Continuous Integration, it should be a priority for the team to keep the Continuous Integration status <em>green</em> (passing) instead of <em>red</em> (failing), fixing any problem as soon as it is detected (<a href="https://continuousdelivery.com/foundations/continuous-integration/#faq">ideally in less than 10 minutes</a>).</p>

<p>Following this approach, automated builds with several checks are performed to our code every time we integrate changes, allowing us to detect any issues in an early stage. <strong>This quick detection of problems makes fixing them much cheaper than in traditional approaches</strong>. When these automated builds are not in place, detection of problems tends to occur much later, often during QA or deployment phases, and many times in production, after having deployed the new version. In those cases, days, weeks or even months have passed and developers have switched context, making it difficult for them to remember the particular cases they were working on when the problem was produced. Moreover, the higher pressure for deployment deadlines at those later stages usually leads to poorer solutions, that not only hinder code quality (reducing its readability and mantainability) but also tend to introduce new bugs.</p>

<h2>Continuous Delivery vs Continuous Deployment</h2>

<p>Once Continuous Integration is set, we may decide to continue improving our processes. The next step would be automating deployments to production, making them faster and safer. Here is where the two remaining techniques (Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment) subtly differ, as can be see in the following diagram:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.romenrg.com/images/continuous_delivery_vs_deployment.png"><img src="https://www.romenrg.com/images/continuous_delivery_vs_deployment.png" alt="Diagram showing usual stages of Continuous Integration and the differences between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment" /></a></p>

<p><em>Difference between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment</em></p>

<h3>Differences explained</h3>

<p><a href="https://continuousdelivery.com/">Continuous Delivery was described by Jez Humble</a>, as <em>"the ability to get changes of all types [...] into production, or into the hands of users, safely and quickly in a sustainable way"</em>. <strong>Continuous Delivery does not necessarily involve deployment to production on every change</strong>. We just need to ensure that our code is always in a deployable state, so we can deploy it easily whenever we want. On the other hand, Continuous Deployment requires every change to be always deployed automatically, without human intervention.</p>

<p>Thus, as can be seen in the image above, if we decide to enhance the pipeline so that, once the Continuous Integration stages are completed, the new artifact is automatically deployed to production, we talk about <strong>Continuous Deployment</strong>. On the other hand, if we manage to automate everything, but decide to require a human approval in order to proceed with the deployment of the new version, we are talking about <strong>Continuous Delivery</strong>. The difference is subtle, but it has huge implications, making each technique appropriate for different situations, as we will see below.</p>

<p>If you need some other references, appart from this article, to be convinced about this difference, notice that a few years ago <a href="https://puppet.com/blog/continuous-delivery-vs-continuous-deployment-what-s-diff">Puppet published a similar comparison</a> in their blog. Also, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/ci-vs-ci-vs-cd">Atlassian has published a longer article</a> on the topic. I hope these articles help clarify these concepts, avoiding the current confusion with them.</p>

<h3>When is Continuous Deployment recommended and when should we opt for Continuous Delivery?</h3>

<p>In general, <strong>Continuous Deployment is great for B2C products</strong>, since as consumers we are used to the constant change of software products, usually assuming their changes without major problems. In fact, consumer companies such as <a href="https://research.fb.com/publications/continuous-deployment-at-facebook-and-oanda/">Facebook or Netflix follow this approach</a>, deploying small changes several times a day to production.</p>

<p>However, <strong>in B2B products as well as in government projects</strong>, it is <strong>often</strong> necessary to include human control to activate deployments to production. In these cases, our changes may affect people and processes in other companies or departments, making it important for us to announce release dates with enough time, so everybody is able to update their processes, learn to use the new features we are about to release or even adapt their software to our API changes. In this context, applying Continuous Deployment (deploying automatically every change to production) could make other software crash, prevent people from doing their job or even lead to economic and legal issues. That is why for these cases, in which we have to set a fixed deploy date, <strong>Continuous Delivery is the technique of choice</strong>, as is our case in Platino. Following this approach we can also automate the whole process, but we provide human control to execute deployments to production, thus controlling when the new version is released.</p>

<h2>Go ahead!</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, these processes are key elements in modern-day software development and provide a significant competitive advantage to software companies applying them. As we have seen above, depending on the software being developed and its usage, we may not be able to opt for Continuous Deployment, being Continuous Delivery the alternative of choice. However, Continuous Integration is the essential practice that serves as a basis for the other two, making it the preferred choice to start off with.</p>

    <updated>2016-11-15T18:34:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.romenrg.com/blog/2016/11/15/the-programmer-bill-of-rights</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>10 years ago, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Atwood">Jeff Atwood</a> wrote an article he titled <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-programmers-bill-of-rights/">The Programmer Bill of Rights</a>. In that article he described 6 fundamentals that companies should provide for programmers to be successful and work to their full potential, thus maximizing their productivity.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.romenrg.com/images/two_monitors_unsplash.jpg" alt="Picture of a programmers desk with two monitors, one of them showing code" /></p>

<p>Sadly, ten years later, many companies still deny these basics to their developers, even though the business case for these six points is absolutely proved.</p>

<p>In this article, not only would I like to update the original 6 principles, providing further evidence of their importance; but also I would like to extend the list. Based on my experience during the last 10 years, I will propose 4 new fundamentals that I consider absolutelly necessary for the daily work of any programmer, developer or software engineer. Let's get started:</p>

<!-- More -->


<h2>10 Fundamental Programmer Rights (6 + 4)</h2>

<p>It is worth mentioning that, despite the headline, <em>this article does not refer to general Labor Rights, since those are usually well-known and its compliance is required by law. This article focuses only on aspects that are specific to software development</em>, aspects that are usually not regulated, but have a huge impact on programmers' daily work.</p>

<h3>The 6 Original Rights proposed by Jeff</h3>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Every programmer shall have two decent monitors</strong>. <br/>
Apart from the scientific studies Jeff linked in his article in 2006, <a href="http://techreport.com/news/14343/more-bigger-monitors-boost-productivity-says-study">many others have emerged more recently</a>, proving the productivity benefits of having two monitors while programming. <a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240088457/Multiple-monitors-boost-productivity-by-355">Some studies even suggest having three monitors</a>.
However, I have met some engineers that prefer to choose one big (27”) monitor rather than two smaller ones; and that should definitely be OK if that is her preferred set-up. <em>The key here is that companies should be wise enough to provide developers with the tools they need to take their productivity to the maximum.</em>
Also, developers working on User Interfaces and graphic designers care a lot about other characteristics such as colors or bright; so again, it is not just about the screen size, it is about taking your employee into account when providing the tools he needs to perform his job in the best possible way.
How is it possible that some companies do not pay attention to this at all? As many people pointed out in <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/story/11/05/16/1957210/do-developers-really-need-a-second-monitor">this slashdot discussion about the topic</a>, the cost of a decent monitor may be around $150 - $200 nowadays. That is a ridiculous amount compared to <a href="http://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/software-developer/salary">the salary of a developer</a>… So it cannot be about the money; since we know that the productivity increase would pay off in just a few days. Sadly, refusals from management to provide the right tools to employees are a clear sign of toxic management or toxic company culture and <a href="#toxic-management-denying-rights">if you find yourself in that situation, you should consider looking for a new job <em>ASAP</em></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Every programmer shall have a fast PC</strong>. <br/>
Although this claim still makes total sense, I think this one is one of the easiest-to-get for management and non-tech people, since everybody has suffered a slow pc and can relate to it more easily. However, I have seen cases in which developers have to connect to a remote machine using a remote desktop. This may cause some performance issues, as well as other problems such as non-functioning shortcuts or hardware compatibility problems. Unless there is a very clear reason to use a Remote Desktop, it should be avoided. As Jeff stated 10 years ago, every developer should have a fast computer that allows her to do all she needs to get her job done.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Every programmer shall have their choice of mouse and keyboard</strong>. <br/>
To be honest, I’m not especially picky with mouse and keyboard, but some developers are… So if you are a manager and one of your developers complains about his keyboard and mouse… Do not waste any time thinking, we are probably talking about less than $50 here. It’s not worth discussing. If his choices are very specific or expensive, at least allow him to bring his own keyboard and mouse from home. Diversity in a company is enriching, so don’t try to treat all your employees as if they were clones.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Every programmer shall have a comfortable chair</strong>. <br/>
I hope this is obvious to everybody in 2016. <a href="http://ergo.human.cornell.edu/AHTutorials/chairch.html">Having an ergonomic chair and sitting correctly is a health issue</a>. In fact, many countries have already created <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/priced/hsg57.pdf">health-and-safety regulations for office chairs</a>. Moreover, money is not a big deal either now, since <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00103102/">there are good chairs for $200</a>. Also, it is worth mentioning that in recent years the <a href="http://ergonomics.about.com/od/office/a/Benefits-of-a-Standing-Desk.htm">benefits of standing desks</a> have become popular, so it could be something to consider. Once again, when it comes to the tools to be used on a daily basis at work, like chairs, the best approach would be to involve employees in the decision. We all may have different preferences, based on our height, weight, back problems, etc…</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Every programmer shall have a fast internet connection</strong>. <br/>
For this claim, the same as in the “fast PC” sections has happened. Apart from the widespread access to broadband internet at low prices; services like Youtube, Netflix, online games and Skype/Hangouts video-calls have made us a great favour. Thanks to them many non-technical managers have realised about the importance of a fast internet connection, making it a default in most companies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Every programmer shall have quiet working conditions</strong>. <br/>
This is a tricky one. Nowadays most offices are open-plan. Moreover, collaboration is encouraged in agile teams. All this makes it difficult to keep quiet working conditions for us to concentrate. Many <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/794212152206729216">relevant people in the industry are raising concerns about this</a>. However, <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/03/stop-noise-from-ruining-your-open-office">there are some things we can do</a>, such as having (and using) meeting rooms, having white noise generators to mask voices, wearing headphones to concentrate (which I usually do) and/or use an indicator to show coworkers if you can or cannot be interrupted. Even though many jobs require concentration, getting to “flow state” is vital to accomplish most programming tasks, as Jeff mentions.</p></li>
</ol>


<h3>My 4 Proposed Additions</h3>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Every programmer shall be free to choose her preferred IDE</strong>. <br/>
In the past it was common to have the build and/or deploy process of the application being developed attached to the IDE (usually by means of a plugin). Fortunately, nowadays the use of build tools has become mainstream, making our build processes IDE-independent. For example, in the Java community, build tools like maven or gradle make it possible for developers in a team to use different IDEs such as Eclipse, Intellij IDEA or any other editors, without any problems of collaboration. They just need to use a version control system (such as Subversion or Git) to share changes and a build tool to generate artifacts. In such environment, forcing developers to use an standardized IDE seems to be only a poor resource of old-school managers used to the “command-and-control” approach to impose their rule. That imposition can only cause a low morale among team members, decrease motivation and cause brain drain in the team, since many talented developers will leave to a more open-minded company.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Every programmer shall have admin rights on his computer</strong>. <br/>
Last year I was introduced to a company that had recently been created with the idea to enter in the software development market. However, I was utterly surprised when I got to know that this company didn’t allow developers to have admin rights in their computers. This is pure nonsense. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/701361">As this fantastic answer in Stack Overflow states</a>, developers in their daily work need to install software for different development purposes (editors, servers, databases, API clients...), they need to change different system configurations for different purposes and, most importantly, they need to be comfortable at work in order to give the best of themselves. Restricting admin rights to developers will only lead to a high turnover rate, inability to retain competent people, poor morale and poor quality delivery. Probably, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/701214/should-developers-have-administrator-permissions-on-their-pc#comment526142_701214">as this other comment states</a>, "if you walk into a job as a developer and find you have no admin rights in your machine, the best choice is to not come back the next day".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Every programmer shall have access to the big picture</strong>. <br/>
Sometimes programmers are not presented with the big picture of the system they are contributing to build, but instead they are given small tasks to do, with narrow descriptions. In those cases, they often do not have direct access to the product owner nor the end users of the software they are working on. This usually causes trouble, since many wrong decisions can be made and many misconceptions can be created. To design software that can evolve properly in the desired direction, developers should understand the big picture, the whole system that is being built, not only the small task that has been assigned to them at one point. Moreover, developers should be free to ask as many functional questions as they need, so they can make the right design decisions and write software that can evolve as expected, avoiding later problems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Every programmer shall have autonomy in his daily work</strong>. <br/>
As any other creative process, programming requires autonomy. That is why agile frameworks, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">Scrum</a>, propose planning work for periods of a week, 15 days or a month; so developers can organize themselves in between. Daily meetings can help detect and resolve problems, as well as keep the development team in sync; but freedom for each contributor to organize his workday without suffering micromanagement should be preserved. The need for autonomy also applies to the programming process, where creativity is key to problem-solving. Some developers prefer to solve a task by creating some tests first, others build a monolithic function and then refactor it, others start by understanding the existing codebase and doing some diagrams... Any of these approaches should be respected, as long as basic agreements of the team (e.g. <em>"definition of done"</em>) and quality standards (e.g. <em>minimum test coverage</em>) are met.</p></li>
</ol>


<p><em>What do you think about these additions? Please, join the conversation!</em> <br/> <em>Are these rights being respected at your company?</em></p>

<blockquote><h3><a name="toxic-management-denying-rights">A real case of toxic management denying many of these rights</a></h3>

<p>Unfortunately, there are companies that keep denying many of these basics today.</p>

<p>I recently saw a case in which a manager refused to replace a defective monitor with obvious flickering problems to an employee (even though flickering may cause dizziness, fatigue and headaches). This very manager was also forcing programmers to work with only one squared 19” monitor (for no reason). He firmly refused to buy second monitors and even forbade some developers to bring a second monitor from their homes… Does it make any sense? However, this guy had two wide monitors in his desk, of course. I guess he just wanted to show that there was a big difference between him and his “subordinates”, who had to be controlled and treated like clones.</p>

<p>As with any other of these rights, a reluctance to provide programmers with two monitors not only shows that your manager or the company board do not care about your opinions or comfort; they don’t even care about productivity. It is definitely a red flag. Taking into account the ridiculously small cost of monitors nowadays, even worrying about it shows a clear case of being “penny wise, pound foolish”.</p>

<p>But that’s not all of it. Usually, when an old-school command-and-control minded manager is violating one of these basics, is probably violating many others, since they are all tightly-linked and it is all about mindset and company culture.</p>

<p>In this particular case, this very manager was also forcing developers to use a three-year-outdated version of Netbeans as IDE, with no front-end support (significantly diminishing their productivity). And, by the way, he had also decided to forbid admin rights to programmers in their own machines (making their daily work absurdly complicated)... So you see, three basics at once. Not to mention that micro-management was also one of the company core values. The micro-manager used to interrupt programmers every hour to closely control their tasks, taking away all the autonomy and long-term vision from the developer.</p>

<p>If you find yourself in a case like this one, my advice cannot be clearer: there are many companies that will be glad to provide the tools you need to achieve the best results in your daily work, so don’t wait anymore, move on. No one should work for a tyrant like that.</p></blockquote>

<p>As an ending to this article, I would like to borrow the last paragraph from Jeff’s article: “The few basic rights we're asking for are easy. They aren't extravagant demands. They're fundamental to the quality of work life for a software developer. If the company you work for isn't getting it right, making it right is neither expensive nor difficult. <strong>Demand your rights as a programmer!</strong> And remember: you can either change your company, or you can <em>change your company</em>”.</p>
