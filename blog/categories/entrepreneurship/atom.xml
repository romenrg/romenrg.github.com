    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In late 2015, based on all the <a href="/blog/2015/03/17/10-plus-1-valuable-lessons-i-learned-from-my-failed-startup/">lessons learned from my startup experience</a>, I decided to create a representation of the <a href="https://geneticstartups.com/info/map#cell-types">different choices startups encounter</a> through their lives, as a map; and then assigned some values and scores to them, so that Genetic Algorithms could be used as a way to learn to navigate those choices.</p>

<p>Originally this was implemented as a dektop application, but I have recently built a web application to let users experiment with <a href="https://www.geneticstartups.com">Genetic Startups</a>. Here is a quick demo video:</p>

<h2>Telling a story based on the algorithm result</h2>

<p>Apart from creating random maps with the different choices, modifying the settings and running the algorithm; there is also a feature to tell a story, based on the final path selected by our algorithm; as if it was the real story of a startup. This feature is showcased in the following video:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a developer, you work on software projects, right? ...Or are they <em>software products</em>?</p>

<p>Like many others in the software industry, you might think those two concepts are synonyms; but they aren’t. In fact, whether the software being developed is considered a project or a product may have critical and non-trivial ramifications, in many aspects.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.romenrg.com/images/products_vs_projects.jpg" alt="Team meeting in which multiple colleagues discuss in a table, where several computres are opened. One man moves hands displaying confusion" /></p>

<p>The <em>not-so-subtle</em> differences between software projects and software products actually have a huge impact on our behavior, both from a business as well as from an engineering perspective.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>For many years I’ve been trying to find the time to write about this key difference, to which many people in tech fail to give importance to. About a year ago, I had the opportunity to give a <a href="https://www2.slideshare.net/romenrg/agile-software-development-beyond-projects-ull">lecture</a> on this very topic. And now, I have finally decided to write about this important topic in more detail.</p>

<p>I'll start with definitions, digging into the key differences that derive from them. Afterwards, I'll explore the critical behavioral ramifications. However, if you just want a quick summary, feel free to jump directly to the <a href="#detailed-comparison">comparison table</a>.</p>

<h2>Let’s start with some definitions</h2>

<p>If we want to get a clear definition of "project" and “<a href="https://www.pmi.org/about/learn-about-pmi/what-is-project-management">project management</a>", the Project Management Institute (PMI) can probably be of some help. From their site we can extract two clear sentences that are relevant in this context:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>project</strong> is temporary in that it has a defined beginning and end in time, and therefore defined scope and resources.</li>
<li><strong>Project management</strong>, then, is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet the project requirements.</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, if we try to look for definitions of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)">product</a>” and “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_management">product management</a>”, we can probably summarize them as:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>product</strong> is an object or system made available for consumer use; it is anything that can be offered to a market to satisfy the desire or need of a customer.</li>
<li><strong>Product management</strong>, then, drives the business case for product development and has an active role throughout its development, test and launch; being also involved in product change and lifecycle decisions and planning.</li>
</ul>


<p>Can you tell the key differences already?</p>

<h2>Digging into the differences</h2>

<h3>Two key differences, from definitions</h3>

<p>From the definitions above, we can clearly see the first big difference: the temporary nature of a project. <strong>Projects are time-constrained efforts</strong>, supposed to have a defined beginning and end date. This clearly-defined temporary nature does not apply to products, which don’t have such predefined beginning and end in time, being subject to market demand instead.</p>

<p>Moreover, those clearly defined time boundaries for projects also bring the second clear distinction: fixed scope and resources (i.e. the project requirements). This doesn’t apply to products either. <strong>Products are evolving creatures by nature</strong>. While project management cares about meeting those predefined project requirements; product management cares about the business case for the product, constantly learning from users and having an active role in the product lifecycle, defining new features and/or re-prioritizing work, adapting to market needs.</p>

<h3><a id="detailed-comparison"></a>Detailed comparison</h3>

<p>When I was preparing my lecture, I found a very nice article by Sriram Narayan in Martin Fowler’s blog. In his article, Sriram added a very comprehensive <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/products-over-projects.html#WhatIsProduct-mode">table comparing project-mode and product-mode</a>.</p>

<p>For this article, I have created my own simplified table; focusing only on some key aspects I would like to compare for the two cases.</p>

<h2>Software development is mainly about building products</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.romenrg.com/blog/2015/09/28/why-asking-developers-for-time-estimates-in-software-projects-is-a-terrible-idea-and-how-to-bypass-it-with-scrum/#the-role-of-evil-contracts">Software development involves many unknowns</a>. Those unknowns make it extremely hard for us to have the certainties "projects" require upfront. At the beginning is when we know the least about the software what we are building.</p>

<h3>In the digital economy, software evolves constantly</h3>

<p>Think of the software you use in your daily life. Isn't it always evolving? You receive constant updates, not only for bugfixing; but also to add new features, <a href="https://www.romenrg.com/blog/2013/01/02/improving-the-ui-to-achieve-a-better-ux-my-experience-in-stat4you/">improve the UX</a>, or even to remove pieces that are no longer relevant.</p>

<p>Does this fit into the definition of "project" we saw before? Do these applications have “a defined beginning and end in time”? And how about scope and resources, do they seem to have been fixed upfront?</p>

<p>Change and evolution are natural in products, but not in projects. Projects don't welcome change. And software evolves constantly.</p>

<h3>Software products and outsourcing are not a good fit</h3>

<p>Traditionally, it has been common for non-software organizations to outsource software development initiatives. For instance, Government agencies typically outsource their “software development projects”, even though in most cases they should have been thinking in terms of software products instead.</p>

<p>Think of an e-gov application in which citizens can perform their bureaucratic obligations from home. Isn’t that a software product? It will have to evolve, as new laws are passed. And it is not supposed to have a predefined teardown day. Instead, we would probably expect it to be there for the long run. Over time, citizens (users) will discover bugs, which will have to be addressed; and we will likely complain about it and/or suggest improvements. There might also be scalability issues and/or outages that will have to be tackled.</p>

<p>Treating these software products as outsourced projects means that the owners will hire an external company to build it. Usually the cheapest. The project will have a fixed scope, and the parties will agree on a timeline and on a price. The external company will complete the project, according to those parameters and hand it over to the customer. Then, usually, the external company forgets about it. If changes are desired in the future, new projects will be defined and outsourced. Often to different companies.</p>

<p>In most cases, the company that is hired to build the software is not involved in the discovery process with potential users. They are not involved in the prioritization of features. They are just hired to do X, as quickly and cheaply as possible. And since they are not rewarded for software quality nor for asking questions, they will probably build it without maintenance in their minds. And they won’t question decisions nor worry about gathering data.</p>

<p>Now, think how different it would be if it was treated as a software product, with an in-house team building it and participating in all the process, from conception to evolution. The team would understand needs, motivations and strategic goals; they would be engaged. They would ask questions. Hypotheses could be defined together and data collection and learning would be in everybody’s mind since the beginning. Working in small increments would be easier. Writing maintainable code becomes crucial. Changes are welcome. And quality matters.</p>

<p>Being aware of the importance of software products in the digital economy means that, if your software is (or is becoming) the core of your business, then you keep software development in-house. Nowadays, every company is a software company. Think of Airbnb, Lyft or Netflix. These businesses could have opted to externalize software development, but they realized the software products they were building are the core of their business. They realized they were software companies.</p>

<h3>How about open source "projects"?</h3>

<p>It is common in the software industry to hear people refer to “open source projects”. In most cases, though, I would argue we should be talking about “open source products” instead.</p>

<p>I have been an open source software (OSS) user for many years, and I have also contributed to open source myself. One example of OSS to which I have contributed is <a href="http://jenkins.io/">Jenkins</a>. Jenkins is the leading open source automation server. It has been around for more than 15 years, with millions of installations worldwide. And it has evolved significantly, including the rename from Hudson, the recent UI changes, and the thousands of ever-evolving plugins, created by a thriving open source community. Based on this data and the previous definitions, should we consider Jenkins an “open source project” or, rather, an “open source product”?</p>

<p>I understand that, when somebody (like Kohsuke with Jenkins) starts to build an open source software, they might have a limited and well defined idea. And they may work on a “project” to make it happen. A project to build the first set of fixed features for their idea. But then, if it is successful, that initial project leads to a product that keeps evolving in unanticipated ways. Scope is no longer fixed, as the community starts to bring new ideas and prioritize their development; and there is no defined “end date”.</p>

<p>Successful open source "projects" are here to stay, for a long time. But their success will keep them evolving within their communities, as <em>software products</em>.</p>

<h2>My personal take</h2>

<p>As you may have guessed after reading this article, I’m a big fan of building software as products. I have built many in my career; and <a href="https://www.romenrg.com/blog/2015/03/17/10-plus-1-valuable-lessons-i-learned-from-my-failed-startup/">I’ve learned a lot</a> from those experiences.</p>

<p>But building software as products is not just what I enjoy the most. It is truly the way I believe we should be building software, to get the most out of it.</p>

<p>Software projects are dead. Long live <em>software products</em>.</p>

    <updated>2016-11-15T18:34:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.romenrg.com/blog/2016/11/15/the-programmer-bill-of-rights</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>10 years ago, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Atwood">Jeff Atwood</a> wrote an article he titled <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-programmers-bill-of-rights/">The Programmer Bill of Rights</a>. In that article he described 6 fundamentals that companies should provide for programmers to be successful and work to their full potential, thus maximizing their productivity.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.romenrg.com/images/two_monitors_unsplash.jpg" alt="Picture of a programmers desk with two monitors, one of them showing code" /></p>

<p>Sadly, ten years later, many companies still deny these basics to their developers, even though the business case for these six points is absolutely proved.</p>

<p>In this article, not only would I like to update the original 6 principles, providing further evidence of their importance; but also I would like to extend the list. Based on my experience during the last 10 years, I will propose 4 new fundamentals that I consider absolutelly necessary for the daily work of any programmer, developer or software engineer. Let's get started:</p>

<!-- More -->


<h2>10 Fundamental Programmer Rights (6 + 4)</h2>

<p>It is worth mentioning that, despite the headline, <em>this article does not refer to general Labor Rights, since those are usually well-known and its compliance is required by law. This article focuses only on aspects that are specific to software development</em>, aspects that are usually not regulated, but have a huge impact on programmers' daily work.</p>

<h3>The 6 Original Rights proposed by Jeff</h3>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Every programmer shall have two decent monitors</strong>. <br/>
Apart from the scientific studies Jeff linked in his article in 2006, <a href="http://techreport.com/news/14343/more-bigger-monitors-boost-productivity-says-study">many others have emerged more recently</a>, proving the productivity benefits of having two monitors while programming. <a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240088457/Multiple-monitors-boost-productivity-by-355">Some studies even suggest having three monitors</a>.
However, I have met some engineers that prefer to choose one big (27”) monitor rather than two smaller ones; and that should definitely be OK if that is her preferred set-up. <em>The key here is that companies should be wise enough to provide developers with the tools they need to take their productivity to the maximum.</em>
Also, developers working on User Interfaces and graphic designers care a lot about other characteristics such as colors or bright; so again, it is not just about the screen size, it is about taking your employee into account when providing the tools he needs to perform his job in the best possible way.
How is it possible that some companies do not pay attention to this at all? As many people pointed out in <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/story/11/05/16/1957210/do-developers-really-need-a-second-monitor">this slashdot discussion about the topic</a>, the cost of a decent monitor may be around $150 - $200 nowadays. That is a ridiculous amount compared to <a href="http://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/software-developer/salary">the salary of a developer</a>… So it cannot be about the money; since we know that the productivity increase would pay off in just a few days. Sadly, refusals from management to provide the right tools to employees are a clear sign of toxic management or toxic company culture and <a href="#toxic-management-denying-rights">if you find yourself in that situation, you should consider looking for a new job <em>ASAP</em></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Every programmer shall have a fast PC</strong>. <br/>
Although this claim still makes total sense, I think this one is one of the easiest-to-get for management and non-tech people, since everybody has suffered a slow pc and can relate to it more easily. However, I have seen cases in which developers have to connect to a remote machine using a remote desktop. This may cause some performance issues, as well as other problems such as non-functioning shortcuts or hardware compatibility problems. Unless there is a very clear reason to use a Remote Desktop, it should be avoided. As Jeff stated 10 years ago, every developer should have a fast computer that allows her to do all she needs to get her job done.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Every programmer shall have their choice of mouse and keyboard</strong>. <br/>
To be honest, I’m not especially picky with mouse and keyboard, but some developers are… So if you are a manager and one of your developers complains about his keyboard and mouse… Do not waste any time thinking, we are probably talking about less than $50 here. It’s not worth discussing. If his choices are very specific or expensive, at least allow him to bring his own keyboard and mouse from home. Diversity in a company is enriching, so don’t try to treat all your employees as if they were clones.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Every programmer shall have a comfortable chair</strong>. <br/>
I hope this is obvious to everybody in 2016. <a href="http://ergo.human.cornell.edu/AHTutorials/chairch.html">Having an ergonomic chair and sitting correctly is a health issue</a>. In fact, many countries have already created <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/priced/hsg57.pdf">health-and-safety regulations for office chairs</a>. Moreover, money is not a big deal either now, since <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00103102/">there are good chairs for $200</a>. Also, it is worth mentioning that in recent years the <a href="http://ergonomics.about.com/od/office/a/Benefits-of-a-Standing-Desk.htm">benefits of standing desks</a> have become popular, so it could be something to consider. Once again, when it comes to the tools to be used on a daily basis at work, like chairs, the best approach would be to involve employees in the decision. We all may have different preferences, based on our height, weight, back problems, etc…</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Every programmer shall have a fast internet connection</strong>. <br/>
For this claim, the same as in the “fast PC” sections has happened. Apart from the widespread access to broadband internet at low prices; services like Youtube, Netflix, online games and Skype/Hangouts video-calls have made us a great favour. Thanks to them many non-technical managers have realised about the importance of a fast internet connection, making it a default in most companies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Every programmer shall have quiet working conditions</strong>. <br/>
This is a tricky one. Nowadays most offices are open-plan. Moreover, collaboration is encouraged in agile teams. All this makes it difficult to keep quiet working conditions for us to concentrate. Many <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/794212152206729216">relevant people in the industry are raising concerns about this</a>. However, <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/03/stop-noise-from-ruining-your-open-office">there are some things we can do</a>, such as having (and using) meeting rooms, having white noise generators to mask voices, wearing headphones to concentrate (which I usually do) and/or use an indicator to show coworkers if you can or cannot be interrupted. Even though many jobs require concentration, getting to “flow state” is vital to accomplish most programming tasks, as Jeff mentions.</p></li>
</ol>


<h3>My 4 Proposed Additions</h3>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Every programmer shall be free to choose her preferred IDE</strong>. <br/>
In the past it was common to have the build and/or deploy process of the application being developed attached to the IDE (usually by means of a plugin). Fortunately, nowadays the use of build tools has become mainstream, making our build processes IDE-independent. For example, in the Java community, build tools like maven or gradle make it possible for developers in a team to use different IDEs such as Eclipse, Intellij IDEA or any other editors, without any problems of collaboration. They just need to use a version control system (such as Subversion or Git) to share changes and a build tool to generate artifacts. In such environment, forcing developers to use an standardized IDE seems to be only a poor resource of old-school managers used to the “command-and-control” approach to impose their rule. That imposition can only cause a low morale among team members, decrease motivation and cause brain drain in the team, since many talented developers will leave to a more open-minded company.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Every programmer shall have admin rights on his computer</strong>. <br/>
Last year I was introduced to a company that had recently been created with the idea to enter in the software development market. However, I was utterly surprised when I got to know that this company didn’t allow developers to have admin rights in their computers. This is pure nonsense. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/701361">As this fantastic answer in Stack Overflow states</a>, developers in their daily work need to install software for different development purposes (editors, servers, databases, API clients...), they need to change different system configurations for different purposes and, most importantly, they need to be comfortable at work in order to give the best of themselves. Restricting admin rights to developers will only lead to a high turnover rate, inability to retain competent people, poor morale and poor quality delivery. Probably, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/701214/should-developers-have-administrator-permissions-on-their-pc#comment526142_701214">as this other comment states</a>, "if you walk into a job as a developer and find you have no admin rights in your machine, the best choice is to not come back the next day".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Every programmer shall have access to the big picture</strong>. <br/>
Sometimes programmers are not presented with the big picture of the system they are contributing to build, but instead they are given small tasks to do, with narrow descriptions. In those cases, they often do not have direct access to the product owner nor the end users of the software they are working on. This usually causes trouble, since many wrong decisions can be made and many misconceptions can be created. To design software that can evolve properly in the desired direction, developers should understand the big picture, the whole system that is being built, not only the small task that has been assigned to them at one point. Moreover, developers should be free to ask as many functional questions as they need, so they can make the right design decisions and write software that can evolve as expected, avoiding later problems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Every programmer shall have autonomy in his daily work</strong>. <br/>
As any other creative process, programming requires autonomy. That is why agile frameworks, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">Scrum</a>, propose planning work for periods of a week, 15 days or a month; so developers can organize themselves in between. Daily meetings can help detect and resolve problems, as well as keep the development team in sync; but freedom for each contributor to organize his workday without suffering micromanagement should be preserved. The need for autonomy also applies to the programming process, where creativity is key to problem-solving. Some developers prefer to solve a task by creating some tests first, others build a monolithic function and then refactor it, others start by understanding the existing codebase and doing some diagrams... Any of these approaches should be respected, as long as basic agreements of the team (e.g. <em>"definition of done"</em>) and quality standards (e.g. <em>minimum test coverage</em>) are met.</p></li>
</ol>


<p><em>What do you think about these additions? Please, join the conversation!</em> <br/> <em>Are these rights being respected at your company?</em></p>

<blockquote><h3><a name="toxic-management-denying-rights">A real case of toxic management denying many of these rights</a></h3>

<p>Unfortunately, there are companies that keep denying many of these basics today.</p>

<p>I recently saw a case in which a manager refused to replace a defective monitor with obvious flickering problems to an employee (even though flickering may cause dizziness, fatigue and headaches). This very manager was also forcing programmers to work with only one squared 19” monitor (for no reason). He firmly refused to buy second monitors and even forbade some developers to bring a second monitor from their homes… Does it make any sense? However, this guy had two wide monitors in his desk, of course. I guess he just wanted to show that there was a big difference between him and his “subordinates”, who had to be controlled and treated like clones.</p>

<p>As with any other of these rights, a reluctance to provide programmers with two monitors not only shows that your manager or the company board do not care about your opinions or comfort; they don’t even care about productivity. It is definitely a red flag. Taking into account the ridiculously small cost of monitors nowadays, even worrying about it shows a clear case of being “penny wise, pound foolish”.</p>

<p>But that’s not all of it. Usually, when an old-school command-and-control minded manager is violating one of these basics, is probably violating many others, since they are all tightly-linked and it is all about mindset and company culture.</p>

<p>In this particular case, this very manager was also forcing developers to use a three-year-outdated version of Netbeans as IDE, with no front-end support (significantly diminishing their productivity). And, by the way, he had also decided to forbid admin rights to programmers in their own machines (making their daily work absurdly complicated)... So you see, three basics at once. Not to mention that micro-management was also one of the company core values. The micro-manager used to interrupt programmers every hour to closely control their tasks, taking away all the autonomy and long-term vision from the developer.</p>

<p>If you find yourself in a case like this one, my advice cannot be clearer: there are many companies that will be glad to provide the tools you need to achieve the best results in your daily work, so don’t wait anymore, move on. No one should work for a tyrant like that.</p></blockquote>

<p>As an ending to this article, I would like to borrow the last paragraph from Jeff’s article: “The few basic rights we're asking for are easy. They aren't extravagant demands. They're fundamental to the quality of work life for a software developer. If the company you work for isn't getting it right, making it right is neither expensive nor difficult. <strong>Demand your rights as a programmer!</strong> And remember: you can either change your company, or you can <em>change your company</em>”.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have worked in many software projects and have been lucky to be in the initial team of several <a href="https://www.romenrg.com/blog/2015/09/28/why-asking-developers-for-time-estimates-in-software-projects-is-a-terrible-idea-and-how-to-bypass-it-with-scrum/">software products</a>. Besides, having acted both as a Developer and as a Product Manager has allowed me to have a wider view of what usually causes most friction between business and engineering: time estimates.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.romenrg.com/images/scrum_software_estimates_reverse_engineering_pixabay.jpg" alt="Picture of a woman pointing to her watch as if you were late. Typical management or customer reaction to delayed software projects" /></p>

<p>It usually starts with managers or customers asking “when will &lt;this idea> be ready?” and it is usually followed by developers racking their brains to give a specific date... Needless to say, that date is likely to be <em>dreadfully wrong</em>, as it is the norm in the industry. There is a near-total inability of developers to predict how long a project will take, so time estimates are usually worthless.</p>

<p>However, applying <a href="http://www.scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a> along with some <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules.html">XP</a> practices we can avoid the uncomfortable tension of asking developers for time estimates. Instead, we can calculate release dates automatically, getting infinitely more accurate time estimates, while saving all the arguments and keeping team morale high. How? Keep reading!</p>

<h2>1. The problem: Time estimates in Software Projects fail dramatically</h2>

<p>The topic of delay and over-budget in the software industry has been widely discussed, including reports such as <a href="https://hbr.org/2011/09/why-your-it-project-may-be-riskier-than-you-think/ar">this one</a> by Harvard Business Review, later commented in this <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2011/10/risky-it-projects">InfoQ post</a>. A conclusion of this report is: <em>“If you want to avoid the slow death caused by IT projects you must be prepared not only to spend 400% more than planned on the project, but to reap only 25% of the expected benefits. If you keep this in mind you can possibly prevent a company from being killed by an IT project”</em>.</p>

<p>Moreover, since 1994 <a href="http://standishgroup.com/">Standish Group</a> has been releasing their <a href="http://blog.standishgroup.com/post/50">CHAOS Reports</a> every year. These reports are a relevant snapshot of the state of the software development industry. <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/standish-chaos-2015">The last CHAOS Report (2015)</a>, shows that <em>even nowadays, only 29% of Software Projects are successful (defined as on-time, on-budget and with a satisfactory result)</em>. This report highlights one of the key variables affecting success rates: the approach used to manage projects (Agile vs Waterfall). <em>Agile approaches showed a 39% ratio of successful projects, while Waterfall only 11%</em>. This seems to be closely related to the way in which we deal with estimates and changes in each case.</p>

<h3>1.1. Let’s assume we never know how long it’s going to take</h3>

<p>I bet some of you consider yourselves great estimators. However, the overconfidence of software developers is a well-known issue. Dan Milstein describes it <a href="http://blog.hut8labs.com/coding-fast-and-slow.html">in this great article</a>, concluding that "one of the deepest challenges involved in writing software is <em>the near-total inability of developers to predict how long a project will take</em>”. In this article, Dan writes in detail about all the issues that make software projects so hard to estimate. Among others, factors such as the impossibility to write fully detailed specifications (as he says, to do so you have to be actually writing the software), uncertainty and unpredictability (about the product itself, the market, the technologies being used...) and the uniqueness of software projects (which makes it almost impossible to relate to similar projects for estimates since there are always major differences).</p>

<p>Moreover, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5596578">in this Hacker News thread</a>, <em>many developers acknowledge "lying" when giving estimates</em>, which is considered an standard practice to deal with customers or management. In the same thread, another interesting recommendation for management is to add <em>a load factor of 2-5x to developer estimates</em>, describing it also as an “industry standard”. As you may guess, these practices are not helping the industry to improve, but rather the opposite. Should we keep ignoring the elephant in the room?</p>

<h3>1.2. Do we really need time estimates?</h3>

<p>There is an increasing tendency among developers against giving estimates in software projects (see <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoEstimates">#NoEstimates</a>). To a certain extent this makes total sense, since time estimates have been proved to fail dramatically in the industry (<a href="https://coding.abel.nu/2012/06/programmer-time-translation-table/">especially for tasks that take more than a day</a> to complete). Besides, developers are usually the ones paying the bill of a failed estimate, by working long hours and suffering great stress due to management pressure to meet deadlines. This usually leads to poor team morale, friction, loss of credibility and many other problems, as described in detail by Richard Clayton in his article “<a href="https://rclayton.silvrback.com/software-estimation-is-a-losing-game">Software Estimation is a losing game</a>”.</p>

<p>On the other hand, since I have been manager and CEO apart from developer, I know how useful would time estimates be from the business side (either to calculate costs for a customer that wants a fixed-price contract; or to ourselves, to plan marketing actions, meetings, etc...). <em>However, we must asume that calculating accurate time estimates for software projects is simply not possible</em>. Putting pressure on developers to give us time estimates will simply make them lie to us, giving a virtually random estimate that is going to be dreadfully wrong. As we have explained before, <em>they just don’t know how long it is going to take</em>.</p>

<p>I guess I don't need to mention that, if developers are not able to give us an accurate time estimate for a software project to be finished in; managers (with no technical background or having spent the last few years out of development) are much worse at it.</p>

<p>So, at this point, as a manager it is worth taking some time to think if we really need to estimate the whole project (or backlog). Maybe we could follow an alternative approach, especially if we own the product we are building. For instance, some innovative companies, such as <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/how-we-set-up-our-work-cbce3d3d9cae">Basecamp</a> or <a href="https://open.buffer.com/6-week-cycles/">Buffer</a> are avoiding long term planning and estimation by working on 6-week cycles. They always focus on the most valuable user stories, adjusting scope to make sure a releaseable version is ready at the end of each cycle.</p>

<h3>1.3 The role of evil contracts</h3>

<p>If there is something to blame above anything else, that would be the magic <em>fixed-everything contract</em> (where price, time and scope are set at the beginning of the project). Those contracts are the root of all evil. The recipe for disaster starts by "setting the cost" of development beforehand (when we know the least about the software being built) and presenting it to the customer in the form of a contract. This contract will describe how a "fixed software" (that in most cases is just a vague idea) will be developed for a fixed price and, of course, ready for a fixed date.</p>

<p>That is how all this madness usually starts.</p>

<p>Most managers and salespeople love this approach. It seems so simple... To "calculate the cost" they just have to ask developers for time estimates, add some contingency time and then do the math (calculating salaries, other expenses, benefits...) and that's it! Ready to convince the customer! What can go wrong?</p>

<p>Well, now that you know that having accurate time estimates for software projects is simply not possible, as a manager you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhE6PVDdZ3dLSS42FLcwYLcH3pldS71MT">choose more realistic contract approaches</a>, or you can <a href="http://blog.salsitasoft.com/why-we-dont-do-fixed-price-software-projects/">assume the risks of doing fixed-everything contracts</a>, based on those more-than-likely-wrong time estimates. But if you choose the latter, don’t blame developers when deadlines are not met.</p>

<p>If you have a team of professional and commited developers, they will be doing their best all the time, trying to do things as quickly as they can (as <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh">@dhh</a> says, <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/584745462445518848">ASAP is implied</a>). Sadly, too many times managers end up using the whip to make developers achieve the impossible. At the end, the imposible is not achieved, software quality goes down because of the rush (causing more delays due to constant bugfixing and poor code-maintainability), team morale is almost zero, everyone suffers burnout and the customer gets angry. Nobody wins.</p>

<p>However, even using these evil contracts, you can always follow an iterative and incremental development process internally, making sure your team is always working on the most important features and releasing an extended version of the product every few weeks. By doing this, you will always have working software to ship to your customer. If the deadline arrives and the project is not finished, at least the X more important features will be developed. And working software will be available. Moreover, if you manage to involve your customer in the process, you will benefit from showing her the incremental releases. Among other things, you will get valuable feedback, anticipate changes and build trust. Therefore, customer relationships will improve and contract changes will become easier to deal with.</p>

<h2>2. An alternative solution to estimate Release Dates</h2>

<p>So, if you are still forced to provide long term release dates, an alternative way to calculate them will be described in this section. This approach is based on combining Scrum with some XP concepts, such as Velocity and User Stories; as well as using effort-based Story Points.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Scrum has become kind of a buzzword in the last few years and many people in the software industry say they use Scrum when in reality they are not following many of its key principles... If you are new to Scrum, I encourage you to read <a href="http://www.scrumguides.org/">The Scrum Guide</a> which is a fantastic 16-pages document written by the creators of the framework describing its principles. You can also find information on XP practices <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules.html">here</a>. Too tired to read? Then a good alternative are these <a href="http://scrumtrainingseries.com/">great videos about the scrum framework</a>.</p>

<p>Although I think Scrum is a great framework for software development, I agree with <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/700746928020176896">Jason Fried</a> and <a href="http://www.agile-doctor.com/2016/03/10/maybe-time-stop-using-word-sprint/">some others</a> that are showing <em>concerns about the word 'sprint'</em>. As they have highlighted, this term can be misinterpreted, leading to behaviors that go against sustainable development, a core <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">agile principle</a>. For that reason, in this article <em>I have decided to use the word 'cycle' instead.</em></p>

<p>Having these definitions clear, all you need to do to get more accurate release dates for your software project is to follow 4 simple steps I will describe below. Since you won't have to ask developers for time estimates, you will avoid many misunderstandings. Besides, this approach allows you to rearrange the product backlog anytime (adding, removing or moving stories), getting approximate release dates automatically.</p>

<h3>2.1. Create a Product Backlog with User Stories as a first step</h3>

<p>Not asking anything to developers yet; no coding. Sit down with your product team, potential users or customers and try to describe what you think the product should be, according to what you have learned so far. If you haven't done it yet, creating some <a href="http://designmodo.com/wireframing-prototyping-mockuping/">simple wireframes</a>, discussing them lightly and iterating a bit over them is usually the best way to start. But keep it simple, following <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/principles">Lean Startup</a> advice. This exercise will help you with <a href="https://steveblank.com/2014/06/28/customer-discovery-the-search-for-productmarket-fit-2-minutes-to-see-why/">customer discovery</a>, clarifying your initial hypotheses.</p>

<p>So, once you have enough information about the product and its market to do so, define some core <a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2010/april/new-to-user-stories">User Stories</a> and prioritize them, creating a Product Backlog for your <em>Minimum Viable Product</em> (MVP). It should represent a basic version that you are able to release quickly, to get feedback from the market and keep learning and adapting, following an iterative and incremental development process. Since user stories are about functionality, wireframes are usually very good help. They can be added as part of their Acceptance Criteria.</p>

<p>My favourite tool for managing Scrum is <a href="https://es.atlassian.com/software/jira/agile">Jira</a>, which includes a great backlog-management tool. However, there are many other tools available, including <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>, which I also use as a kanban board for smaller projects. For wireframing, there are also many good tools available. One of my favourites is <a href="http://wireframesketcher.com/">WireframeSketcher</a>, due to its IDE and CVS integration. <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a> and <a href="https://moqups.com/">Moqups</a> are great alternatives too.</p>

<p>After creating the initial Product Backlog, you will have a much clearer picture of the MVP you are going to build; therefore, you will be in a better position to present it to developers.</p>

<h3>2.2. Estimate all User Stories in the backlog based on effort points</h3>

<p>Once you have created your initial Product Backlog and prioritized its user stories, it is time to have the first Product Backlog Refinement meeting with the Scrum Team (which includes the Development Team). Our goal would be to estimate all user stories in the backlog, but instead of time we will be using effort points. Each user story will have X points. A common approach is to use the Fibonacci scale for those points.</p>

<p>Since it is very important to be consistent when estimating user stories, I usually encourage the team to <em>find the easiest user story in the backlog and give it a 1 and then find the hardest one and give it either a 13 or a 21</em>. That way you have created the team’s effort scale, making it easier to estimate the remaining user stories based on a scale that is totally dependent on the project.</p>

<p>“But those effort-points are not useful for me!”, a manager said. Please, hold on. They definitely are. For now they tell you which are the easiest user stories and which ones are the hardest. But even better, in a few cycles they will help you estimate when might the project be finished or when will a specific user story probably be done, according to its place in the backlog. And this estimate will be much more precise than any you could get from asking developers for time estimates.</p>

<p>If in the future new user stories appear <em>(they will)</em>, all you have to do is add them to the backlog, placing them according to their relative priority compared to the rest; and save some time to conduct a backlog refinement meeting, in which the new stories will be estimated. The most important task of the Product Owner (your role in Scrum) is to keep the backlog updated, estimated and prioritized; in order to make it useful for predicting possible release dates.</p>

<h3>2.3. Keep effort-based estimates time-independent</h3>

<p>Even though agile implementations usually replace time estimates by effort points (using scales such as Fibonacci or t-shirt sizes), some managers simply establish a link from those points or sizes to "their equivalent" in time. And they usually do that publicly, which means that everybody goes back to time estimates, thus ruining the whole thing again and making developers hate agile too (even though what they hate is a bad implementation of agile frameworks).</p>

<p><em>The key of using an effort-based system for story points is precisely to keep estimates separated from time</em>. The relative "effort" of a task is a much easier concept to analyze for developers, especially when comparing different user stories of a project. Moreover, estimating effort instead of time prevents common conflicts, mostly related to considering time estimates a "contract". As we have seen before, developers simply cannot estimate how long a software project is going to take. Linking effort points to their "time equivalent" will only lead to poor team morale, friction and false expectations, as we have seen before. Avoid that. There is another way to get to time estimates: indirectly!</p>

<h3>2.4. In the first few cycles Team Velocity is yet unknown</h3>

<p>When planning a cycle <em>(sprint)</em>, the team will pick user stories from the top of the backlog until they consider it is enough work for the new cycle. Having a shared <a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2008/september/what-is-definition-of-done-(dod)">Definition of Done</a> can help planning, making sure all team members are aware of all the tasks that have to be completed for each story to be "done".</p>

<p>Then, during the cycle review you will discover whether all user stories were completed as expected or if there were some changes (e.g. the team was not able to complete all user stories, or by constrast, all stories were completed early and some more were added to the cycle).</p>

<p>As you will see, in the first few cycles there are usually some differences when comparing what the team planned to achieve and what it did actually achieve. However, this error tends to become smaller over time, achieving a similar pace, measured in number of story-points completed per cycle. This metric is often referred to as <em>Team Velocity</em>.</p>

<p>It is worth highlighting the importance of minimizing changes related to team members (eg. replacing someone or changing her dedication). Any change of this sort will have a significant impact on velocity, which would undermine our capacity to forecast release dates.</p>

<h3>2.5 After a few cycles you will be able to estimate release dates, based on Team Velocity</h3>

<p>So, once a few cycles <em>(sprints)</em> have passed, you will realize that if the team and its story-point estimates have remained consistent, the number of story points being completed per cycle (Team Velocity) is similar.</p>

<p>Since you have been doing your job of keeping the backlog updated, prioritized and estimated in story points, now you will be able to forecast when will a particular story be finished.</p>

<p><em>An <strong>example</strong> will make it clearer:</em></p>

<p><em>Let’s say our development team is applying the strategy described in this post. It is completing about 25 points per cycle and each cycle is 15 days long. If you want to know when will a particular user story be finished, all you need to do is count the number of story points that are above it in the backlog, add its own story points and do some simple math:</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.romenrg.com/images/story_points_estimates_backlog_example.png"><img src="https://www.romenrg.com/images/story_points_estimates_backlog_example.png" alt="Example showing a backlog with story points, estimated based on effort; team velocity, cycle duration and a forecast for a particular story" /></a></p>

<p><em>In this example, user story X has 52 points above it in the backlog and has 5 points itself. This means a total of 57 story points have to be completed for story X to be finished. Since in each cycle the team is completing approximately 25 points, the story you are looking for will probably be finished in 3 cycles time, meaning it would be deployed in about 45 days.</em></p>

<p>The same process can be applied to guess when could the whole project be finished, just taking the last user story you have in the backlog for the calculations explained before.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>There is no silver bullet in software estimation. However, if you need to prepare marketing actions or respond to a customer, you will probably need at least a rough idea of delivery dates. Following the management approach described in this article, you will get time estimates without asking for them; you will keep team morale high, avoid burnout and improve productivity. Besides, you will be able to automatically forecast the impact of changes in the timing of the project.</p>

<p>This solution contributes to improve business-engineering relationship, improve software quality and reduce costs in the long-run. Besides, if you involve customers in the process, their understanding and trust may improve considerably, making it easier for both parties to deal with change, preventing many deadline-related conflicts.</p>

<p>Now, join the conversation: How do you deal with time estimates in your company?</p>

    <id>https://www.romenrg.com/blog/2015/03/17/10-plus-1-valuable-lessons-i-learned-from-my-failed-startup</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: right;"><em>...That I will take into account for the next one.</em></p>


<p>Being the Founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.vocabularynotebook.com">Vocabulary Notebook</a> for more than 2 years (from September, 2012 to January 2015) was one of the most intense, enriching, stressful and exciting experiences I have ever lived.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.romenrg.com/images/nomad_wide_800pxwidth.png" alt="Picture of a man using a writing machine and smoking with a pipe" /></p>

<p>During this period I went from doing some mockups alone at home and printing them in paper to use them as low fidelity MVPs for customer discovery; to close a seed funding round, found a company, build a multiplatform product, build a team of 12 people, receive several awards, participate as speaker in 3 international events, get 30 000 users in more than 130 countries, register a trademark, conduct scientific research on our product and collaborate with schools and universities from 4 different countries... As I said before, it was intense!</p>

<p>Sadly, two years after the beginning of this adventure we had not been able to reach the break-even point yet, we had a cost structure that we were not able to maintain and we didn’t manage to close another funding round to keep us going (to keep improving the product, launching marketing campaigns, validating new hypotheses, pivoting and improving our business model...). So, by last summer we had to start progressively reducing our cost structure, until we had no option other than shutting our startup down completely.</p>

<p>However, during this amazing period <em>I learned very valuable lessons</em>, some of which I am going to share with you now, if you keep reading:</p>

<!-- More -->


<ol>
<li><p><strong>Validating your hypothesis with the real customer may be very difficult in some B2B models.</strong> Being lean with B2B models is usually a lot harder than with B2C models. In our case the toughest part was interviewing "the real customer", this is, the person that was actually going to pay for the product. Vocabulary Notebook was intended to be sold to schools. From the beginning we tried to be very lean, so we did customer discovery and tried to validate our hypotheses with students and teachers (our users). We did so, learned from them and pivoted a few times based on their feedback. We made sure both students and teachers found the tool valuable and that teachers considered the pricing solutions acceptable for the school. However, since our goal was to sell the product to (mostly private) schools, we must had been interviewing school directors instead. They were the ones with enough power to make the final decision (paying for the product). All the same, as the CEOs of any other company, they are usually very busy people and it is very difficult to have the chance to arrange a meeting with them. What is even worse: if you manage to arrange a meeting with a school director to make a presentation of your product and she finds out that what you are just asking some questions to validate some hypotheses, or that, what you are offering is still in development phase, she will probably feel that you are making her waste her time and will probably ask you to come back later, when the product is ready.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Being Interested” and “paying” are <em>very</em> different.</strong> It is important to remember that it is very easy for anyone to say <em>“Wow! this looks great, we will definitely use it!”</em> when not being forced to pay <em>now</em> to prove that the interest is real. In our case, many times when we had meetings with schools, everyone looked excited. Teachers usually seemed very interested in combining language learning and technology; and our product looked just like the right fit for them... But it was always very difficult to close a deal at this point. At this stage, they were typically telling us that they would have to discuss it in further detail, as well as organize themselves to try to include the product in the school plan for the next course (in which they were going to use it for sure…). This is something typical in B2B models: <em>sales cycles are long.</em> For us this meant waiting several months to close the deal, either until the end of the current course or until the very beginning of the next one… And as you can guess, most of the time when the next course arrived, nothing happened. They had been very busy and they had not been able to plan the inclusion of our product for the new course (but... <em>"we are still very interested! Next year we will include it for sure!"...</em>). We tried to reduce friction and accelerate adoption by providing them with materials and pilot projects, even offering in-house consultancy to "kick-start" the project in the school, which helped us "land and expand"... But it had huge implications in our Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC). So the point I want to make here is: <a href="http://steveblank.com/2014/06/28/customer-discovery-the-search-for-productmarket-fit-2-minutes-to-see-why/">Customers paying for your product or service is the only real validation of your business model</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Connections are worth more than money.</strong> You will need connections in the market in which your target customers are (this is, in which your product is). Seriously, you will need them. This is <em>really</em> important, because as human beings we rely on our connections, either to decide whether to purchase a particular product or to decide if it is worth writing an article about it or not. For instance, if you are building a vocabulary platform which you are intending to sell to schools, you will need to be well connected with schools: you will need to have a good relationship with many school directors, teachers, teacher trainers, specialized researchers in the field, specialized bloggers and/or media, etc. If you don’t have those relationships yourself, you better find a partner or employee that has those connections. It is definitely worth it. Those connections will bring you money, it may be in the form of specialized investors, by saving money in expensive ad campaigns or, what is even better, in the form of important paying customers or early adopters that you wouldn’t have been able to reach otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>You will need money for marketing.</strong> This is very related to the previous point. Selling is very hard. And very expensive. This is especially important for founders with a tech background. It may seem to you that you can build the next great app in a garage on your own (or with a few friends), with no funding at all and without marketing &amp; sales teams. <em>You may think that all you have to do is to build the right product and suddenly... it will go viral all alone and you will get rich!</em> Well... Honestly, that is extremely rare, even if you have a great product. It is so rare that probably most of the cases you think went viral all alone had actually a team that planned carefully their marketing campaigns and invested a lot of money and/or talent on them, <em>even if it doesn’t look like that</em>. A good example of this may be crowdfunding, and particularly, Kickstarter. Nowadays, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2014/08/06/backed-with-millions-startups-turn-to-crowdfunding-for-marketing/">many of the companies having successful Kickstarter campaigns have already been backed with investment before</a> (even millions). These companies are using Kickstarter as a marketing tool, which provides more visibility and more customers (either directly or indirectly). Companies are investing a lot in those campaigns to make them go viral (design, content, videos, pricing strategy, advertisement...). It is not just about creating a great product, <em>it is about making many people believe your product is great.</em> And that is expensive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make sure you get enough rest.</strong> Building a company is not a sprint, it is a marathon. It is easy to get too involved, to work almost every minute of the day, long hours, weekends, to keep thinking in your business even when you are having lunch with family or friends, or even when you are watching a film with your girl... But <a href="http://andrewdumont.me/avoiding-burnout/">if you work too hard for too long you may burn out</a> and then everything will fall apart. Many entrepreneurs have been there before. Make sure you disconnect and have quality rest every now and then. Set some spare time apart and do some exercise. Do it for your own health and personal life. Once you start doing it you will realize that it also helps your startup a lot. Since you will feel better, you will have more energy, bring new ideas and be more productive at work.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Analytics are crucial.</strong> If you haven’t heard about KPIs, web analytics or A/B testing yet, it is time to work on it. When you are a startup founder and you get some traction you end up realizing that you want to measure everything. Not a lot of things. Everything. <em>Where do the users come from? How many of them came through the last tweet we posted? How much time do visitors that come from the sponsored post in xxx spend in our site on average? If I change the sign-up button background to green, will it increase conversions? How much is the acquisition cost of my users through Google Adwords? ...And what is the lifetime-value of those users?</em> Everything is important. Data is a key element in a startup. You need to make decisions based on data, otherwise you are guessing and guessing can lead you to lose a lot of money. Remember, it is not what we like or how do we behave using our product, it is all about how our users and customers do. Avoid opinion-based strategy meetings with your team. As Jim Barksdale (CEO of Netscape) once said: <em>“If we have data, let’s look at data. If all we have are opinions, let’s go with mine”.</em> Let's focus on having data!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Remember what your role should be.</strong> When your startup starts running it is very easy to be overwhelmed. Specially if you are a solo founder or if it is your first time in the startup world. At some point things start to get mad: your product starts generating some revenue, customers start to ask for bugfixes or new features; you start going to several startup events (<em><a href="http://zaman.io/startup-conferences-are-mostly-a-waste-of-time/">which sometimes are just a waste of time</a>, to be honest</em>); you start having too many meetings... You have to hire new people, coordinate a bigger team… And at the same time you try to keep in touch with investors and customers, try to close further funding rounds and deals… <em>With all that chaos it is very easy to lose focus on the most important things of your startup: developing your business, validating your hypotheses, analysing the performance of your product, reviewing your KPIs, doing some A/B testing, reviewing customer feedback, making strategic decisions...</em> Remember what your role should be.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be sure to build the right team.</strong> Very related to the previous point. It is crucial to have talented people with different skills in your team, so you can delegate different areas, such as administration, finance, software engineering, product management, marketing or sales. Sometimes, especially with tech founders, we tend to underestimate other areas rather than product development, or some of us tend to do everything. And it may be the case that you can also be skilled in other areas, but the reality is that there is too much work to do and you can’t do it all. Moreover, there is always work that you like and work that you don’t, and you tend to work on what you like, even unconsciously. In my case I always tended to focus either on product development, user experience, analytics or business strategy; but always tried to avoid paperwork. Sadly, I didn’t have anyone in the team to delegate paperwork tasks and it ended up being a significant part of my daily workload, preventing me from doing the other things I really liked.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be careful with side projects.</strong> We always tend to underestimate the cost of losing time. For instance, when you don’t have enough funding to be 100% focused on your product, it may be tempting to start doing other side projects for your company to “survive”, until somehow we hit the hockey stick with the product and can focus totally on it. Paradoxically, by doing that you may be killing your startup, since you may start devoting too much time to those side projects, having meetings with those “side customers”, paying less attention to the users of your product (because money comes from the side projects)... It is a risky solution and most of the time you will end up losing focus on your product and becoming a zombie startup. Be very careful with side projects.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be very careful with government grants and / or loans.</strong> Funding is one of the toughest things for a startup founder (if not the toughest). The lack of funding can lead us to accept side projects, work too-long hours and even apply for grants and loans. The government, at least in Spain, in the last few years has created programs to help fund startups with grants and, mainly, with loans. However, <em>these programs are not lean at all</em>, they will involve a lot of paperwork (including 5-years-ahead cash flow tables with month-by-month detail); there will also be a lot of uncertainty until you get their answer (and even after it is approved uncertainty may be around); you may have to re-do things several times… And money may arrive late (or may not arrive, or not the full amount). My point here is that, although government has created these programs with good intentions, trying to help startups, you should be very careful. It may be a bad idea if you are trying to be a <em>lean</em> startup. Maybe you can consider it as a last resort... But in case you decide to go through this risky path, you better be aware of what it involves. It could even be a good idea to have someone in the team devoted exclusively to these tasks, <em>so you can stay focused on the important stuff (developing your business and validating hypotheses).</em></p></li>

<p>Well... If you have reached this far, you have been patient enough to discover 10 key things I learned during my adventure as Founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.vocabularynotebook.com">Vocabulary Notebook</a>. Probably I am forgetting another 10 things that are at least as important as these, but it is always difficult to summarize such an overwhelming experience in a post like this. That being said, I will be glad to read any opinions and stories from others with similar experiences. Feel free to write a comments below :).</p>

<p>Finally, I also wanted to add an extra thought here (<em>the +1 in the title</em>), which is not related to this particular experience, but is something I have seen too many times happening and has even happened to me before in previous startups:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>“Lean Startup” does not mean “it’s a hobby”.</strong> To validate a few hypotheses, iterate and build an MVP you will need to take it seriously, invest real time and some real money as well; although a reduced amount of both money and time when compared to traditional approaches to building companies, in which people spent millions and years to create and execute business plans with no validation whatsoever. But you will definitely have to invest several hours a day to build, measure and learn in order to validate your hypotheses. And this is just the beginning. After your first validations you can decide that it is not worth to continue with your startup (if you haven’t been able to validate your business model and have no plans on pivoting). But if you get positive feedback you should probably take it even more seriously. This will force you to be 100% committed. You will need to interview a lot of potential customers, build a great team, look for funding, participate in events, build a product, organize marketing campaigns, analyze your KPIs... <em>It will be a lot of work.</em> So be honest to yourself: is it a hobby or is it a startup?</p></li>
</ul>


<p>If you want to build a great company from the ground, there is just one thing I can guarantee you: <em>You will have to work hard</em>. But if you are passionate, you will love the experience. No matter if your startup ends up failing. You will learn a lot, meet awesome people, have this incredible feeling of discovering that something that you created was valuable to other people (maybe at the other end of the world)... <em>It is an awesome experience.</em> And if you pay attention to other founder’s experiences, you may avoid some mistakes and thus make this adventure a bit easier, increasing your chances of success. I hope this article may help you with that.</p>
