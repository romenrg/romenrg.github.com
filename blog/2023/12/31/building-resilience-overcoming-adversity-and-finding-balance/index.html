<div class="entry-content"><p>Resilience is the ability to bounce back from setbacks. It is definitely a critical skill to have, especially during difficult times; although it is often overlooked.</p>

<p><img src="/images/resilience-man-sunrise-nature.jpeg" alt="An image of a man, taken from behind, in nature, looking at sunrise" /></p>

<p>Personally, I have always considered myself quite resilient. However, 2023 has really made me prove it. And, to be honest, it has been a very challenging year. That is why I figured that writing about it would be the best idea for my end-of-year article.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>When we face challenging situations in life, especially those that cause profound damage to our life pillars, our self-esteem and/or our mental health in general; it might be hard to find purpose, meaning and/or maintain a healthy lifestyle. Plus, for knowledge workers, it is especially hard to stay productive in such circumstances.</p>

<p>However, there are some tips that can be very useful to help us bounce back, building resilience and balance, in both personal life and work:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Prioritize self-care</strong>: Taking care of oneself is essential, especially during difficult times. Make sure you are getting enough sleep, eating healthy, and exercising regularly. You can also try meditation or other relaxation techniques to help manage stress. And I would highly encourage you to start one fun social activity, be it cooking lessons, acting classes or dance lessons; to meet new people and take a break from problems, while doing something new and fun.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Set boundaries</strong>: It is important to set boundaries between your personal life and work. This can include setting specific work hours, turning off your phone or email after work hours, and taking breaks throughout the day. Also, you might need to take time off to take care of your mental health depending on the seriousness of the challenge. Think of it as if it was a serious physical injury. Wouldn’t you go on medical leave if that was the case? The support of your colleagues and manager are key as well. Be as open to them about your situation as you can, this will help them empathize and understand your situation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Build a support system</strong>: Having a strong support system can help you get through tough times. This can include friends, family, or even a therapist. Don’t be afraid to reach out for help when you need it. We, as humans, are social creatures; and no matter how self-sufficient you are, certain situations are too much for an individual to handle without support.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stay positive</strong>: It is important to stay positive and focus on the things that you can control. And let go of those that you cannot control. Try to find the silver lining in difficult situations and focus on the things that you are grateful for.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Practice resilience</strong>: Resilience is a skill that can be developed over time. It is important to practice resilience during difficult times. This can include setting goals, staying focused, and taking small steps towards your goals every day. But don’t be too hard on yourself. It is ok to have bad days. However, in those days, don’t stop prioritizing self-care and the good habits you are building, including your social routines, which are critical in rebuilding your mental health.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Find purpose</strong>: We all need a project in life, a long-term goal. Something to strive towards, which motivates us long term. Something that gives meaning to our life. Without a purpose, life can turn into a depressing, self-consuming void. Personally, my main purpose revolves around two little people, who bring profound meaning to my life. For them, I strive to be the best version of myself, willing to endure anything to care for them. Aday and Haridian, my son and daughter. Your father loves you both, with all my heart. And always will. This love is unconditional and unwavering.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Well, I think the former 6 points are critical when trying to overcome difficult situations. Hope this article helps others as much as it helps myself.</p>

<p>In summary, it is okay to take time for yourself and prioritize your well-being. Building resilience and reconstructing your life during tough times takes time and effort, but it pays off when you are finally able to bounce back.</p>

<p>Remember, nurture and love yourself. Ultimately, you are your lifelong companion, the one constant presence that will surely be with you throughout your entire journey.</p>
