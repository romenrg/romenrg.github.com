  <div class="entry-content"><p>The 8th of September 2012 I started to work intensively on an idea I called Vocabulary Notebook. With that idea I was planning to solve a problem that myself and many other English students experience while learning vocabulary. It has already been a year since then and that idea is now a real platform used by thousands of students and teachers around the world. I must say that I’m quite proud of what we have achieved during this year, both as an entrepreneur and as an engineer. Although I don’t have much free time now, I have forced myself to write this post to summarize what has happened around Vocabulary Notebook during this year, from idea to reality. Since there are so many things that have happened, I’m afraid this post is going to be quite long, but I think the anniversary deserves it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I would like to start this post anouncing that this month I am leaving <a href="http://www.arte-consultores.com">Arte Consultores Tecnológicos</a>, after one year and seven months working there as an Analyst/Programmer (Front-end Engineer). I have made this decision because right now I need to devote myself exclusively to Langproving, which is in need of my full atention at this critical moment in which our MPV is finished and we have to market it to validate our business model.</p>




<p>In this period of time working at Arte Consultores, I have improved significantly as an engineer. I have learnt a lot. Fortunately, I have had the great pleasure to work closely with my workmate and friend <a href="http://www.axelhzf.com">Axel Hernández</a>, who I admire for his ability to constantly learn new technologies and for being always aware of all the new trends in software development. I&#8217;m proud to say that I have learned a lot from him. I would like to think — actually, I hope — that he has also learned something from me too while we have been working together.</p>




<p>One of the most valuable things I learned working at Arte was related to writing modern and usable web interfaces, not only with CSS3 animations or HTML5 new attributes and tags; but also with Javascript. In the last few years Javascript has grown up and become one of the keys of the evolution of the web. Many Javascript frameworks have emerged, ranging from those regarding DOM manipulation (jQuery) to others built to reproduce the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern in the client side, such as <a href="http://www.backbonejs.org">Backbone.js</a>. For more than a year I have been using Backbone to create Single-page applications that provide a quick response to user interaction, without the need to re-render the full page from the server as we were used to; thus improving sifnificantly the user experience (UX).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had this article started but uncompleted since September 2012, and as a New Year’s Resolution for 2013 I decided to finish it.</p>




<p>Back then, I had been working for some months as a Front-end engineer in <a href="http://www.stat4you.com">Stat4you</a>. In the early summer we were in a hurry to finish the alpha version of the platform, so we released it without paying too much atention to the details. A feature that was included in this release were the filters for the charts, by means of which users were able to change the positions of the dimensions and also to enable and disable the categories of those dimensions, thus changing the chart being displayed.</p>




<p>The images below are screenshots of the filters initially released in Stat4you:</p>


<p><img src="/images/s4y_table_filter.png" /></p>

<p><em>The image above shows the filters available for the tables in the initial alpha version of the platform. The blue elements represent the containers of the dimensions which, in this case, have been also placed in a particular way to help the user understand the position in which every dimension will appear. The white elements represent the dimensions whilst the orange ones represent the categories of each dimension.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Front-end engineer is a relatively recent role in software development, but its importance is growing everyday as the importance of Javascript does. I&#8217;ve been working as a front-end engineer in the <a href="http://www.stat4you.com">Stat4you</a> project since January and in this article I will try to describe this role, emphasize its importance and highlight the differences that the introduction of Javascript has brought to the development of the front-end of web applications.</p>




<p>I would like to introduce this article with a quote from the human-computer interaction expert Jeff Raskin that summarizes quite clearly the importance of software interfaces from the perspective of users. It reads: <em>“As far as the customer is concerned, the interface is the product”</em>.</p>




<p>Although the quote above seems quite obvious, often developers and managers tend to forget or underestimate the importance of user interfaces, blinded by the complexity of the back-ends of the applications. This blindness has led many projects to failure, but fortunately this is starting to change.</p>




<p>In order to continue highlighting the importance of user interfaces, there is another quote from Linus Torvalds on this topic which I also fully agree with: <em>“In many cases, the user interface to a program is the most important part for a commercial company: whether the programs works correctly or not seems to be secondary”</em>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been trying to set up a new Blog for a while, but to use a nice excuse, I haven&#8217;t had enough time to do it. On Friday I was talking with my workmate <a href="http://www.axelhzf.com">Axel</a> about <a href="http://www.octopress.org">Octopress</a> and it seemed interesting to me. I have just finished the installation and deployment of it using <a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a> and it has been rather easy.</p>




<p>While I was reading about Octopress, I found <a href="http://inessential.com/2011/03/16/a_plea_for_baked_weblogs">this post</a> where the author writes about the importance of static rendering for webpages and blogs at present. Nowadays the most popular CMS systems store post and pages in a database and then they build the pages from the database on every request. Although it is also true that there are some cache plug-ins to improve this behavior, he states that this traditional implementation is inefficient. This idea reminded me that two years ago, when I built my own CMS for personal websites Sigecu CMS, I had this idea in mind, so what I did was to generate a static HTML page every time the user makes a change in the website, avoiding this problem. I would try to write some posts in the future about Sigecu.</p>
