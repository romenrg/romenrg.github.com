  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>My name is Romén Rodríguez-Gil. I'm a Lifelong Learner who seeks continuous improvement and cares about the human side of technology.</p>

  <p>As a Software Engineer and Internet Entrepreneur I have worked in several software companies, research teams and startups, wearing many different hats.</p>

  <p>Thanks to the Internet I have learned much of what I know. In return, with this blog I try to make my little contribution, hoping to help somebody else.</p>
