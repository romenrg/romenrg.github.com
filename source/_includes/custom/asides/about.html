  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>My name is Romén Rodríguez Gil. I am a Software Engineer, UX Researcher and Internet Entrepreneur who is lucky enough to live in the beautiful island of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenerife">Tenerife</a> (Spain). </p>

  <p>I have worked in several software companies, research teams and startups, wearing many different hats. I like to share my experiences, not only in this blog but also giving talks and courses in different events and institutions.</p>
