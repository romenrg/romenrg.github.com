 <p>My name is Romén Rodríguez Gil. I'm a computer engineer graduated from the University of La Laguna (Teneriffe, Spain), where I obtained both my degree and my M. Sc in computer engineering, obtaining also in both cases the best academic record award.</p>
  <p>I have collaborated in research projects through the University of La Laguna, having been analyst and the main developer of the educational web platform Ematic. Currently I'm working as an analyst/programmer in Arte Consultores, mainly dedicated to the Stat4you project.</p>
  <p>My entrepreneurial spirit involves me in many personal projects, such as Sigecu CMS or Turawet. This latter project, which began as my end of masters project, won a finalist award in the entrepreneurs contest "Conocer es valer" (Knowing is worth) in 2011.</p>
  <p>So far, this professional path has made me specialize in the web applications development, with technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Backbone, Bootstrap, Highcharts, Java, Spring MVC, Python and Django, among others.</p>
