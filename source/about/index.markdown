  <p>My name is Romén Rodríguez-Gil and I live in the beautiful island of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenerife">Tenerife</a> (one of Spain's Canary Islands). Besides a Software Engineer and Digital Entrepreneur, I'm a Lifelong Learner who seeks continuous improvement and cares about the human side of technology.</p>

  <p>The digital world has fascinated me since I was very young. I started building software about two decades ago, and I've been wearing many different hats in the industry since then. As a software engineer, I have worked on many different products, teams and technologies. As a manager and entrepreneur, I have led several multidisciplinary teams and worked on business development, product management, user experience and digital marketing, <a href="https://www.romenrg.com/blog/2015/03/17/10-plus-1-valuable-lessons-i-learned-from-my-failed-startup/">learning very valuable lessons</a>. I have also been <a href="https://www.romenrg.com/talks/">lecturing</a> for a while, sharing what I've learned so far in my career. Thanks to these varied experiences I've developed a 360-degree view of the creation and evolution of software products, which I consider a great asset for a software engineer to have.</p>

  <p>My current interests are in the technical space. I thrive building <a href="https://www.romenrg.com/blog/2020/12/30/software-projects-vs-software-products/">software products</a> in healthy and transparent environments, where people are always willing to collaborate and where motivation is pursued through our intrinsic motivators: autonomy, mastery and purpose.</p>

  <p>As an engineer, experience has taught me to focus on <a href="https://www.romenrg.com/blog/2018/12/29/what-makes-a-great-software-engineer/">core skills and portable technical principles</a>, rather than on framework-specific knowledge. I'm also a big fan of combining Agile Software Development frameworks (such as <a href="https://www.romenrg.com/blog/2015/09/28/why-asking-developers-for-time-estimates-in-software-projects-is-a-terrible-idea-and-how-to-bypass-it-with-scrum/">Scrum</a>) with engineering excellence (as <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules.html">eXtreme Programming</a> does). I truly think that combination, along with a data-driven <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">Lean Startup</a> mindset, provides a huge potential for success.</p>

  <p> But above practices, tools, or processes, I'm convinced <em>"<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Teams-3rd/dp/0321934113/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=F07A2E2YJ4AQ5JZQRK5B">Peopleware</a>"</em> is the key element of every knowledge-based company; even though many forget about that. As a blogger, <a href="https://www.romenrg.com/talks/">speaker</a> and consultant I try to highlight the importance of building a healthy company culture, where people feel safe, valued, and can grow. I see this as the foundation to create a successful environment, both for developers and for managers; and from a business as well as from an engineering perspective.</p>

  <p>Well, that is me <em>professionally</em>. But apart from all the above, I also love to spend some time away from technology, be it having fun with friends, playing with my kids or hiking.</p>

  <p>If you want to know more about me, you can explore the <a href="https://www.romenrg.com/talks/">talks & courses</a> section, where recordings and materials of my talks are shared. You can also take a <a href="https://github.com/romenrg">look at my GitHub</a> repositories, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/romenrg/en"LinkedIn>find me on LinkedIn</a> or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/romenrg">follow me on Twitter</a>, where I share more thoughts, news and articles about software, internet and entrepreneurship.</p>

  <p>By the way, I'm always open to considering new adventures when there is a good cultural fit. So, if what I have described here resonates with you and your team, feel free to reach out. I'll be happy to chat.</p>
