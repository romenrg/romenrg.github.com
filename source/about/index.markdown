  <p>My name is Romén Rodríguez-Gil and I live in the beautiful island of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenerife">Tenerife</a> (one of Spain's Canary Islands). Besides being a Software Engineer and Digital Entrepreneur, I am a Lifelong Learner who seeks continuous improvement and cares about the human side of technology.</p>

  <p>I love building great software products and thrive in healthy and transparent environments where people are always willing to collaborate and where motivation is pursued by following what Daniel Pink considers our intrinsic motivators (autonomy, mastery and purpose).</p>

  <p>The digital world has fascinated me since I was very young. I started building software about two decades ago, and I have been wearing many different hats in the industry since then. As a software engineer, I have worked on many different products, teams and technologies. As a manager and entrepreneur, I have led several multidisciplinary teams and worked on business development, innovation management, user experience and digital marketing, <a href="https://www.romenrg.com/blog/2015/03/17/10-plus-1-valuable-lessons-i-learned-from-my-failed-startup/">learning very valuable lessons</a>. Thanks to these varied experiences I have developed a 360-degree view of the digital industry, which I truly think is a great asset for a software engineer, since it helps me focus on delivering value.</p>

  <p>As an engineer, experience has taught me to focus on <a href="https://www.romenrg.com/blog/2018/12/29/what-makes-a-great-software-engineer/">core skills and portable technical principles</a>, rather than on framework-specific knowledge. Over the years, I have also learned the huge potential of combining <a href="https://www.romenrg.com/blog/2015/09/28/why-asking-developers-for-time-estimates-in-software-projects-is-a-terrible-idea-and-how-to-bypass-it-with-scrum/">Agile Software Development</a>, with <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules.html">XP's technical practices</a> and a data-driven <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">Lean Startup</a> mindset.</p>

  <p> But above practices, tools, or processes, I am convinced <em>"<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Teams-3rd/dp/0321934113/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=F07A2E2YJ4AQ5JZQRK5B">Peopleware</a>"</em> is the key element of every knowledge-based company; even though many forget about that. As a blogger, <a href="https://www.romenrg.com/talks/">speaker</a> and consultant I try to contribute my bit by highlighting the benefits these empirical and more human approaches provide, both for developers and for managers; and both from a business as well as from an engineering perspective.</p>

  <p>Despite all the above, I also love to spend time away from technology, be it having fun with friends, training at the gym or going hiking with my wife.</p>

  <p>If you want to know more about my background, you can explore the <a href="https://www.romenrg.com/talks/">talks & courses</a> section, where recordings and materials of my talks are shared. You can also take a <a href="https://github.com/romenrg">look at my GitHub repositories</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/romenrg/en"LinkedIn>find me on LinkedIn</a> or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/romenrg">follow me on Twitter</a>, where I share more thoughts, news and articles about software, internet and entrepreneurship.</p>

  <p> I am always open to considering new adventures when there is cultural fit. So, if what I have described here resonates with you and your team, feel free to reach out. We could probably achieve great things together.</p>
