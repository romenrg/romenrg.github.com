  <p>My name is Romén Rodríguez-Gil and I live in the beautiful island of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenerife">Tenerife</a> (one of Spain's Canary Islands). Besides a Software Engineer and Digital Entrepreneur, I'm a Lifelong Learner who seeks continuous improvement and cares about the human side of technology.</p>

  <p>The digital world has fascinated me since I was very young. I started building software about two decades ago, and I've been wearing many different hats in the industry since then. As a software engineer, I have worked on many different products, teams and technologies. As a manager and entrepreneur, I have led several multidisciplinary teams and worked on business development, innovation management, user experience and digital marketing, <a href="https://www.romenrg.com/blog/2015/03/17/10-plus-1-valuable-lessons-i-learned-from-my-failed-startup/">learning very valuable lessons</a>. I have also been lecturing for a while, sharing what I've learned so far in my career. And even though my current interests are in the technical space, thanks to these varied experiences I've developed a 360-degree view of the creation and evolution of software products, both from a technical as well as from a business perspective; which I consider a great asset for a software engineer to have.</p>

  <p>I thrive building software products in healthy and transparent environments, where people are always willing to collaborate and where motivation is pursued through our intrinsic motivators: autonomy, mastery and purpose.</p>

  <p>As an engineer, experience has taught me to focus on <a href="https://www.romenrg.com/blog/2018/12/29/what-makes-a-great-software-engineer/">core skills and portable technical principles</a>, rather than on framework-specific knowledge. Over the years, I've also learned the huge potential of combining <a href="https://www.romenrg.com/blog/2015/09/28/why-asking-developers-for-time-estimates-in-software-projects-is-a-terrible-idea-and-how-to-bypass-it-with-scrum/">Agile Software Development</a>, with <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules.html">XP's technical practices</a> and a data-driven <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">Lean Startup</a> mindset.</p>

  <p> But above practices, tools, or processes, I'm convinced <em>"<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Teams-3rd/dp/0321934113/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=F07A2E2YJ4AQ5JZQRK5B">Peopleware</a>"</em> is the key element of every knowledge-based company; even though many forget about that. As a blogger, <a href="https://www.romenrg.com/talks/">speaker</a> and consultant I try to contribute my bit to humanize businesses, by highlighting the benefits these empirical and more human approaches provide, both for developers and for managers; and both from a business as well as from an engineering perspective.</p>

  <p>Despite all the above, I also love to spend time away from technology, be it having fun with friends, playing with my son or hiking with my wife.</p>

  <p>If you want to know more about my background, you can explore the <a href="https://www.romenrg.com/talks/">talks & courses</a> section, where recordings and materials of my talks are shared. You can also take a <a href="https://github.com/romenrg">look at my GitHub</a> repositories, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/romenrg/en"LinkedIn>find me on LinkedIn</a> or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/romenrg">follow me on Twitter</a>, where I share more thoughts, news and articles about software, internet and entrepreneurship.</p>

  <p> I am always open to considering new adventures when there is a good cultural fit. So, if what I have described here resonates with you and your team, feel free to reach out. We might achieve great things together.</p>
