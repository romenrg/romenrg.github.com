  <p>My name is Romén Rodríguez-Gil and I live in the beautiful island of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenerife">Tenerife</a> (Spain). Besides being a Software Engineer and Internet Entrepreneur, I am a Lifelong Learner who seeks continuous improvement and looks at the human side of technology.</p>

  <p>The digital world has fascinated me since I was very young. Professionally, I have been working in the software industry for more than a decade, wearing many different hats. As a software engineer, I have worked on many different products, teams and technologies. As a manager and entrepreneur, I have led several multidisciplinary teams and worked on business development, innovation management, user experience and digital marketing, <a href="http://www.romenrg.com/blog/2015/03/17/10-plus-1-valuable-lessons-i-learned-from-my-failed-startup/">learning very valuable lessons</a>. Thanks to these varied experiences I have developed a 360-degree view of the digital industry.</p>

  <p>Over the years, I have become a convinced supporter of <a href="http://www.romenrg.com/blog/2015/09/28/why-asking-developers-for-time-estimates-in-software-projects-is-a-terrible-idea-and-how-to-bypass-it-with-scrum/">Agile Software Development</a>, as well as its business counterpart, Lean Startup. Moreover, I am also well aware that <em>"<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Teams-3rd/dp/0321934113/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=F07A2E2YJ4AQ5JZQRK5B">Peopleware</a>"</em> are the key element of knowledge-based companies, although many forget about that. In this sense, as a blogger, speaker and consultant I try to contribute my bit by highlighting the benefits these empirical and more human approaches provide, both for developers and for managers.</p>

  <p>Despite all the above, I also love to spend time away from technology, be it having fun with friends, training at the gym or going hiking with my wife.</p>
