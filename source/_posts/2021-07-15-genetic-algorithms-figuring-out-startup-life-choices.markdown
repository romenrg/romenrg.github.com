In late 2015, based on all the [lessons learned from my startup experience](/blog/2015/03/17/10-plus-1-valuable-lessons-i-learned-from-my-failed-startup/), I decided to create a representation of the [different choices startups encounter](https://geneticstartups.com/info/map#cell-types) through their lives, as a map; and then assigned some values and scores to them, so that Genetic Algorithms could be used as a way to learn to navigate those choices.

Originally this was implemented as a dektop application, but I have recently built a web application to let users experiment with [Genetic Startups](https://www.geneticstartups.com). Here is a quick demo video:

## Telling a story based on the algorithm result

Apart from creating random maps with the different choices, modifying the settings and running the algorithm; there is also a feature to tell a story, based on the final path selected by our algorithm; as if it was the real story of a startup. This feature is showcased in the following video:

## More information

If you want to learn more about how the algorithm is implemented or about the tech stack behind this web application, you can take a look at the following video, or visit the [info section of Genetic Startups](http://www.geneticstartups.com/info).

## Want to contribute?

Genetic Startups is open source software. It is also a work in progress and a hobby project, so many improvements can be made. Constructive contributions are welcome. Please feel free to comment in this post, or refer to the main [GitHub repository](https://github.com/romenrg/genetic-startups) of the project for more information on how to contribute. I look forward to hearing your thoughts!
