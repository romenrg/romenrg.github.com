If've been trying to set up a new Blog for a while, but to use a nice excuse, I haven't had time to do it. On friday I was talking with my workmate <a href="http://www.axelhzf.com">Axel</a> about <a href="http://www.octopress.org">Octopress</a> and it seemed interesting to me. I have just finished the instalation and deployment using GitHub and it has been pretty easy.
